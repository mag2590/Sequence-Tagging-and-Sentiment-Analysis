{} the title comes from the markings found on packages delivered by the postal service <0>
the inspiration of the film comes from the studiolike hollywood musicals of the s <0>
according to rivette he was most influenced by stanley donens musical give a girl a break <0>
his other influences are the great french directors of the past such as renoir and vigo <0>
i rented up down fragile along with rivettes first feature paris belongs to us and it was interesting to see how rivette kept some of the same themes how one has the need to be alone and also the need to be with a group how one handles reality and fantasy and the politics of being <0>
it is his firm belief that the individual alone is responsible for his lifes direction it is ones responsibility to take charge of ones life not anyone else <0>
in his newer film which was stylistically and cinematically a much more sophisticated and welldone production than the former we see these themes come out clearer brought out by a director who is more assured of his abilities to work with actors on a more experimental basis as they each collaborate on the script as he gets them to improvise in their roles <1>
{} the film follows the life of its three main characters ninon natashe louise marianne and ida laurence as they try to work out their many problems in life occasionally breaking out in song and dance at the oddest moments even when the film is moving along in a dramatic fashion <0>
this lighthearted approach to the film annoyed me on my first viewing but when i watched the film for a second time i felt more relaxed and was able to get in the mood rivette probably intended for his film to be viewed which is that it is up to me to fill in the meaning of the story <1>
but this also allowed me not to take this film as a very serious work but more or less as a spectacle in the hollywood tradition a tradition that rivette gladly acknowledges a kinship and admiration for <-1>
{} its entertainment value was enhanced by the gorgeous use of colors which captured the summertime paris streets and parks as well as the beautful indoor sets <1>
we followed the moped messenger exwhore ninon do her deliveries <0>
then we viewed louises splendidly delicious living quarters she is from an upperclass family having just been released from a clinic after being fiveyears in a coma following an accident <0>
she is being followed for her own protection by an neophyte bodyguard lucien bruno hired by her father without her knowledge to protect her <0>
she will awkwardly meet and fall in love with him <0>
ida is the adopted orphan working as a librarian looking for her real parents wanting to find out why they put her up for adoption still plagued by that <0>
roland andre is the set designer the male thread that connects all three women heroines the gene kelly lookalike <0>
he meets louise in her aunts house the one she has just inherited he falls in love with ninon at the site of their respective workplaces which are on the same street where she works as a messenger and he designs stage sets and lastly he meets ida while doing research in the library she works at hearing her hum a tune that he recognizes which turns out to be a song sarah anna uses in her nightclub act a place he often frequents <0>
sarah is the real mother ida has been looking for <0>
{} that this musical is better than most of the hollywood musicals it flatteringly immitates is true to a certain extent <1>
it is better in the sense that rivette is able to bring out the poetry of the reallife situations and present his existential view of life and not just play for the song and dance to be the thing though the hollywood performers are more professional and have better voices and quicker feet is certainly true but they also seem to rely on an artificial story <-1>
while for rivette as amateur as his performers might seem to be in comparison the story still seems real and important and the musical numbers are intrusive but seem to be imbued with a magical quality about them that makes them seem just as fantasy oriented as the typical hollywood production and in my opinion that makes for a more interesting and better film <1>
though it makes for a different way for american audiences to appreciate the musical a form of film that hollywood at one time was the most innovative creators of but has now all but abandoned that genre because of high production costs and not enough box office gross to show for its efforts <-1>

{} you can watch this movie that is based on a scifi work by robert heinlein either as a straight gungho war film or you can see it mostly as a spoof <-1>
anyway you watch it wont require too much gray matter from your brain cells because you will either find this film entertaining and a feast for weary eyes or you might like me think that this film is so bad that it really couldnt be this bad i must be missing something <-2>
but i have come to the conclusion that this insipid b movie is that bad despite the high production costs it took to make it <-2>
{} if there are any good parts to this film it might be in the occasional sardonic one liner such as this one that makes light of the films heavy assault on our sensibilities as one soldier is telling the hero of the story youre good at killing bugs <-1>
this came after a big battle between the two opposing armies <0>
{} basically the film should be seen as a war movie because its spoof of the military grew thin very fast for me as it got carried away with the cartoon characters it has stereotyped going for an overkill on a spoof that is so obvious in the first place that by spending so much time with spoofing the military is just plain unnecessary <-2>
it is the last half of the film that takes over the movie anyway as the film becomes all about killing the bugs who have invaded a city called bueno aires <0>
thats the town all our hero kids come from in the story <0>
{} i guess the film is set in the future but it sure looks like the present to me despite all the computer graphics as it makes use of its astronomical budget to become solely a computerized special effect movie that should endear itself to the mtv generation <-1>
there is no subtlety to the continual spoofs against the military personnel <-1>
the mindless story traces a bunch of high school graduates and their dedicated teacher wellacted by michael ironside as they all join the military for all the reasons that prevail at the present time for why people join <0>
{} after awhile all the performers looked alike to me but i wouldnt be doing my duty as a movie reviewer if i should fail to point out that there is some kind of melodramatic love story going down among the four stars of the film rico casper van dien the school football hero loves carmen denise richards the school beauty and math brain who is set on becoming a pilot which is the reason rico joins the military <1>
there is some kind of mumbojumbo talk among them about the difference between a citizen and a civilian a citizen does his duty by joining the military and protecting the federation a civilian makes lots of money and goes to harvard as what ricos folks wanted him to do <0>
the other part of the love story is that dizzy flores dina meyer a football jock and an attractive filly is in love with rico but he spurns her attention <0>
but persistence pays off she joins him in the infantry while carmen falls for her copilot a dude named zander patrick muldoon and the rivalry between rico and zander is about as thrilling as having a spider crawl up your leg <0>
{} i dont think you get much bang for your money out of this film unless you are really into special effects or found this sophomoric satire funny or you are a reactionary then i think you will find many things to like about this empty hearted attempt to put ww into an outer space conflagration film <-2>

{} a heartrendering film capably directed by the actor now turned firsttime director tony goldwyn for and about the baby boom generation taking place in upstate new york where a lower middle class couple annually rent a bungalow for the summer in a jewish resort and react to all the change that is in the air for the country and for them in the summer of <1>
it was the summer of the vietnam war protests neil armstrongs walk on the moon and woodstock so the music in the background is appropriately enough from joni mitchell carole king grateful dead richie havens dylan and hendrix and so on which should bring on a case of nostalgia for those who were around during that period <1>
there should also be some nostalgia left over for the days of bungalow colonies as family vacation spots for those who might have experienced that sort of vacation when growing up or raising a family <0>
{} like the other couples heading for their summer oasis the featured couple like to keep time how long it takes them to get from the city by car to their catskill mountain lodgings with the red apple being the famous rest stop on the thruway and the halfway point in their commute <0>
pearl kantrowitz diane lane is the restless housewife asking her steadfast television repairman husband marty liev schreiber why do we do the same thing every summer <0>
his unsatisfactory response to her is because we do <0>
the eldest child the yearold alison anna paquin seen wearing a peace medallion around her neck and is also seen rebelling against her parents lack of idealogy while her younger brother danny boriello is dressed in a cowboy hat and is just an innocent kid <0>
the housewifes motherinlaw the perceptive lilian tovah feldshuh who is a visionary and is very close with her son especially so after her husband just took off and left her one day and her son swore he would look out for her from here on <0>
she feels sorry that her son who dreamed of being a scientist but went to work as a television repairman as the easiest way to support his wife had to give up his childhood dream <0>
{} the kantrowitzs met when she was a teenager and he was a waiter in a resort hotel and the first time they made love the yearold virgin became pregnant with alison which led to their marriage something the husband says is the best thing that has happened to him even if that marriage led to his not becoming a college graduate but a television repairman <0>
she now feels that she cant communicate her feelings to her husband that life has past her by <0>
she complains to him that the most important decision that she has to do as a housewife is to choose whether to shop in the ap or at waldbaums <0>
his response is that the ringdings are fresher at the ap <0>
{} the bungalow colony is a place where everyone knows everyone elses business where the men work in the city during the week and come up for the weekend <0>
it is a place where visitors such as the knish man is announced so that the colony will know that he is on the premises <0>
one of the visitors to the bungalow colony is the handsome blouse man walker jerome viggo a freespirited hippie type peddling his wares from colony to colony who bought out the regular blouse mans truck and route <0>
tempted by what seems to be the greener grass on the other side of the fence pearl has an affair with the gentle and laidback hippie on the night of the walk on the moon and is seen by her daughter with him while attending the nearby woodstock concert <0>
the film purposefully means to mirror the couples life with the changes that altered the face of the nation during that period <0>
{} the ramifications of her affair becomes common knowledge to the family and threatens the marriage a marriage where the husband has done nothing wrong and is if anything too good <0>
marty goes out of his head at the thought of her with another man and will go into an uncontrollable rage feeling the one thing he was most secure about in life has been taken away from him while pearl wrestles with her sense of responsibility and with what she really wants to do <0>
finally she decides not to ride off with walker and live a hippiestyle of life and the superstraight marty decides to loosen up a little and get with the new music coming into vogue <0>
{} the story allows mother and daughter to come to terms freely with who they are as alison has her first period and her first boyfriend and is exploring who she is just like her mother is currently doing <0>
the conflict between mother and daughter reflects on how this particularly volatile time in american history resulted in a sexual revolution and in a generational movement of attitude changes that forced families to face what was in the air at the time or else wide gaps developed in family relationships <0>
{} the moral question the film raises about adultery can only be resolved accordingly by the parties affected and so what happens in the films mild rendering to the problem seems credible at first glance as it is put forth in a way that worked out for the films sake but might not have seemed correct for many a viewer or at least it was not important enough to be resolved by the film even if that clash was supposedly the whole point of the film <0>
{} the acting was convincing the story had a nice feel to it and it followed along with the historical mood the country was going through at that time <2>
the yearnings for a new kind of freedom and to step away from the old boredom of other generations was in the air as a counterculture was constantly being dangled in front of all types <0>
what the film lacked was resolution <-1>
the aim of the film was realized as a small step for a troubled woman feeling the need for passion in her life and getting it via an affair but there were no gigantic aims to be accomplished after pearl takes her gigantic leap into the arms of her hippie lover <0>
i thought that the fleeting affair she had with the longhaired sculptured adonis figure certainly satisfied her sexual needs but the bigger moral question of adultery was never even attempted to be answered with any kind of satisfactory response which left me believing that the liaison was the thing here just like in those romantic pulp fiction books that are an easy read with nothing more to tax your mind <0>

[17757/a]
{} a flawlessly made film magnificently acted with beautiful cinematography to go with a compelling story about a school bus accident resulting in the death and injury to all the children on board the bus that tears the heart out of an isolated smalltown in british columbia a story that is very difficult to cover in all the implications it has for the families and ambulance chasing bigcity lawyer mitchell stephens ian involved yet it does do just that as adapted from a russell banks novel and brought to screen not only intact but with a certain forcefulness that reflects the directors ability to dig deeply into the story and make it both accessible and innovatively chilling <2>
{} from the opening scene where ian receives a call on his cell phone while in a car wash from his daughter zoe caerthan who is a druggie in and out of drug clinics for the past years and a disappointment to ian and his separated wife she hates them both equally as she once loved them both equally as a child <0>
she will call him at all hours and their conversations are regrettably filled with rancor though they never stop the relationship completely even though there is no hope for it <0>
something went terribly wrong and either party doesnt know what else to do <0>
one of the most touching and memorable scenes of the film is the distraught ian telling a school chum of zoe while on board a plane to meet zoe how she was bitten by a baby spider when she was and how he rushed her to a hospital miles away prepared to do anything to save her even operate on her in the car with a pen knife if necessary <1>
{} the film does not move along in a linear timeline so it is constantly going back and forth from events leading up to the accident to the perplexed guilt and anger that permeates ians thoughts about his failed relationship with zoe <0>
so when ian arrives at his first potential clients place which is a motel owned by alberta and maury we already know much about the accident and why ian is there and we quickly learn from the couple all the foibles and gossip about the other potential lawsuit clients ian hopes to represent such as the goingons of incest and thievery among his potential clients <0>
later on we learn that the likable good guy of the story billy bruce is having an affair with alberta <0>
{} ian is very intense almost over the edge but he makes sense to these victims and he requires no payment if he loses the case but will be getting of the settlement if he wins <0>
he is able to convince many of the others involved to retain him the others apparently get another lawyer even though there is really no one to blame for the accident it was simply the case of dolores gabrielle the very able driver of the bus driving slowly but still hitting an icy spot on the road and the bus going over the guard rail on the side of the mountain and sinking in the soft ice below <0>
ians argument is that there are no such things as accidents someone must be blamed and if it is not the driver then it could be the bus company that might be apt to cut corners on safety <0>
the important thing is that they need compensation for their grief and anger since their children cant be brought back to life then money will have to do <0>
and this we learn also applies to himself as he considers himself a victim just as much as they are which is why he thinks that he can easily identify with these parents and their grief he has told himself that his daughter is already dead and he thinks this is the way he is to get compensated for his grief <0>
{} in case you didnt get the thrust of the story from that angle the theme of the story is again presented as nicole sarah the baby sitter to billys kids reads them a robert browning nursery poem the pied piper the night before the accident <0>
hes the one who killed all the rats in town and when the town refused to pay him he led all the children in town away except the one who was too lame to follow into a magical place where everything was strange and new <0>
nicole survives the accident but is crippled ruining her chances of being a rock and roller while the kids she baby sat for die <0>
billys habit was to follow the bus to school he loved his kids so much and with his wifes death he loved to wave to them as he drove behind them and they would wave back to him from the back of the bus <0>
thereby he witnessed the accident and felt drained from it especially when he was unable to help as he saw his kids die <0>
{} nicoles parents zealously back the law suit to the regret of billy and nicole <0>
billy vehemently states that this will split the town apart forever that there was no one to blame for it let it be <0>
nicoles reasons are more nefarious it seems ironic that the theme of the poem she read to billys kids will the next day mirror her situation and since she has a poker face she surprises her seemingly loving parents and startled lawyer by lying at the deposition <0>
{} this all adds up to a brilliant film <2>
one of the best of the recent lawyer genre films now being made it is the best one i have seen and the only reason it is not a masterpiece in my opinion is because it was too real something metaphorical about it was lacking i went away from the film intellectually gratified but did not feel the film opened up the emotional wounds of the locals whereas they would see anything more about the tragedy than the fact that their lives had been changed even if some of the locals now question their motives to retain a lawyer and that is now questioned in a way that it has never been questioned before <1>
i have no problem with that aspect of the film that was convincingly conveyed to me as was the lawyers motives who comes across to us as not a good or an evil man he is a man driven and ripped apart by guilt even to the point of exhibiting bizarre behavior as he searches to find a meaning for his life that he doesnt quite understand anymore which is apparently more true than his belief that he is so committed to his work because he is trying to find justice for his clients so what we have what remains for us to ponder is the fact that nothing is as simple as the accident is everyones life has been changed and nothing is the same anymore <0>
but the question that still remains is what has anyone learned from this and that is left lingering because there is an emotional disconnect inbred in the story when all is said and done and we dont know for sure if anything was learned <-1>
nevertheless atom egoyan has created a splendid artistic film <2>
he should be acknowledged by now as one of our greatest living filmmakers <2>

{} how many other directors could handle with great deftness the innuendoes of this potentially sexually explosive relationship between an attractive and problematic widow with a young daughter emmanuelle and a handsome yearold priest belmondo during the german occupation of a small french town <2>
melville establishes his exquisite control of the subject matter by allowing the story to unfold in such a perfect manner <2>
i suspect not many directors have that kind of grace and understanding of life <2>
melvilles sense of how to tell a story has influenced many directors through his long career starting in the late s and that list would include the great director bresson who developed the same style and feel for filmmaking as melville who at times outdoes melvilles melville giving some the false impression that melville imitated bresson <2>
{} melvilles success comes through the intelligent use he makes of his eye for seeing what is spiritual and what is intelligent and allowing it to be emotionally compelling <2>
his characterization of the occupation and how some survived it by becoming collaborators with the germans or by becoming part of the black market or by becoming part of the resistance movement is accomplished by relating the priest to all that goes on in town and how the priest brings out his ideas of what god is and how tolerance is the message of all sane people even as the horrors of what the nazis stand for is glossed over in the background its evil is still felt by those who must live under them meanwhile melville is connecting the religious needs of the community and the deportation of the jews with the personal savior jesus christ who he reminds us died as a jew <0>
the implication being for those who think that because they are christians they dont have to be concerned about what is happening to the jews are sorely mistaken because they have forgotten who christ is and how he died for everyone and how if he was around today he would be a jew taken away to the death camps <0>
the priest sees his task in life as a fulfillment of his christian vows by helping those who need to be helped no matter what they believe in <0>
he appeals especially to the women in town as a sort of modern day christ that results in some very complex emotional questions being raised relating to mundane matters and affairs of the heart and spiritual quests <0>
{} belmondos performance as a priest who questions authority and is not afraid of what others might think is superb as he attracts many women practitioners especially leaving himself vulnerable to public opinion when he openly maintains a very close relationship with the widow <2>
his argument for a god couldnt be put forth with more verve and intelligence even though it didnt convince me as he was not challenged with counter arguments by any one in the film who had the ability to present a cogent differing opinion nevertheless this film moved me to further expand what i think <1>
it even shows that it is possible to have a truly spiritual person be a part of the church something that i have rarely come across outside the cinema <1>

[17713/c-]
{} this rambling marathon of an epic movie aspiring for greatness in filmmaking but in reality is a real snoozer erupting for a few electrifying scenes and going on for what seemed an eternity to tell the years of yugoslavian history by dividing it into parts the german invasion in the cold wartito socialist state period and the ethnic cleansing and war period in <-2>
{} the best scenes are the ones that featured the brass band used from the opening invasion scene where we see the band march raucously over the ruined landscape for no particular reason and then is used intermittingly throughout the film <1>
it woke me from my snooze each time and gave life to a film that needed resuscitation <-1>
a film that tried desperately to find humor in its madcap antics and absurd characterization of individuals which i understand to be political jibes but i still found them to be made in a heavy handed manner and were not funny <-1>
{} the first part of the film is devoted to the friendship of two formidable con men who each vie to out con the other <0>
these parts are played by two fine actors miki who is the communist intellectual and later corrupt gun runner and lazar who is the adventurer and risk taker <1>
they both seduce the sexually active mirjana who plays an actress caught up in the wars and politics of the times that she doesnt want to understand <0>
the most memorable scene here is the zoo being bombed by the nazis and the animals running free which is example of another too obvious piece of symbolism <1>
{} part is where miki outcons his friend lazar and keeps him and his group locked up in a secure cellar not telling them the war has ended a long time ago <0>
miki rises in power in the tito peacetime government and grows rich by selling weapons <0>
all the deceptions and hypocrisies of the leaders are reiterated over and over along with the filmmakers yearning for a unified country this is done an unnecessary amount of times until it becomes annoying to see every image as a symbol of the same theme <-2>
{} the most absurd scene from part is reserved for when a movie is being made for the dead national hero lazar and the living hero comrade miki and lazar reappears as the movie is being made <-2>
{} part recaps the latest tragedy there is no more yugoslavia of titos era brother is killing brother <0>
the u n is severely blamed for its inability to be useful in stopping the war <0>
{} what saved this film from bombing out completely was the excellent technical skills of the director and the robust performances from the two male leads and because this part of the world is in the news again with its problems that draws us into their civil wars having started the century with its ethnic conflicts and will end the century with its problems still not resolved <1>
other than that i couldnt wait for the film to end <-2>
