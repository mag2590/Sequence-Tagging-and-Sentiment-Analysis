[20198/c-]
{} for three quarters of the film an exciting somewhat plausible thriller takes place that is even occasionally intriguing <1>
then it comes apart and turns into routine hollywood copout stuff <-1>
as a result this film wastes splendid acting jobs by clint ed and scott <-1>
{} clint is luther whitney a renowned thief who finds his way into the hidden vault of the billionaire sullivans marshall mansion and robs him of his jewels and cash <0>
but complications arise while luther hides in the vault looking out from behind a oneway mirror and mrs sullivan melora comes home inebriated and begins having some rough sex with alan richmond gene <0>
he happens to be the president of the united states <0>
things get out of hand and when the two secret service agents scott and dennis see that the president is about to get knifed to death they shoot mrs sullivan <0>
gloria russell judy the presidents chief of staff then starts the coverup rolling <0>
the result is that luther has to go on the run <0>
{} what remains entertaining is that the badgood guy luther being chased by the goodbad guy alan while the goodgood guy the chief police investigator in the homicide and robbery seth frank ed tries to unravel the mysteries of the case <0>
it is no mystery to the audience because they saw exactly what happened <0>
so what this film is all about is the amorality of the president and the absolute power he wields and the catandmouse games between the police and secret service and luther <0>
there is also some romance going on but of the blandest kind imaginable between clints estranged daughter laura whom he still cares a great deal about and seth frank <0>
{} it is watchable hokum with a hardly credible story getting by solely on solid acting jobs from the leads <1>
the script calls for no bold statements about the politics of the white house which makes the film rather weak in scope and purpose <-1>
yet the film is bearable fortunate to be in the hands of someone as deft as clint or else with a lesser director it could have certainly sunk to an abysmally lower level though one wouldnt be far wrong thinking it has already sunk to that level <-1>
