{1} before delving into the reasons crouching tiger hidden dragon isnt the unqualified masterpiece its been touted as lets revel in the reasons its still a cinematic joy in a year of mostly leaden entertainments <>
in one of the films many inspiring action sequences a pair of adversaries square off in battle employing a mystical fighting technique that allows its adherents to virtually defy gravity <>
this particular battle takes place not in a bar or in a city street but above a forest with the combatants surfing the leaves and tapdancing across branches <>
it is the moment when its easiest to appreciate crouching tiger hidden dragon as a giddy exercise in pure cinema showmanship <>
over and over again it lifts you out of the mundane world of a theater seat <>
{0} it also drops you back into that seat a bit roughly every once in a while but why quibble <>
as directed by ang lee the story is both mythologically basic and epic in scope <>
in an unspecified year in the days of imperial china veteran wudan warrior li mu bai chow yunfat is preparing to retire from his fighting ways <>
his famed sword green destiny is to be carried by his longtime friend and unconsummated love shu lien michelle yeoh to peking as a gift to elder statesman sir te sihung lung <>
but the sword is soon stolen by a mysterious figure familiar with the ways of the wudan one who is able to match shu lien in battle <>
is it the infamous jade fox who once slew mu bais master <>
or is it jen zhang ziyi the young daughter of a politician who longs for a more adventurous life than the one designated for her <>
{2} as solid as the narrative is in many ways it would be ridiculous to argue that its critical and commercial success will be rooted in the story <>
crouching tiger hidden dragon is first and foremost an adventure one that turns choreographed action into pure film art <>
the action sequences combine the astonishing talents of fight choreographer yuen woping the matrix with spectacular wire work to create moments that make you want to stand up and applaud <>
theres never even a sense of redundancy as the film progresses each sequence serves its own purpose and offers wonderful variations on the clashing of metal feet and fists and escapes up sheer walls <>
its pure indiana jones fun with an unexpected sense of consequence <>
{1} its also a martial artsheavy film in which the thematic elements actually matter <>
while crouching tiger is certainly enjoyable as a distaff spin on the usually testosteronesoaked chopsocky genre its more than a feminist action flick <>
it explores the human toll of unthinking tradition tradition that wears the kind of deep grooves into the world that in one lovely early scene shu liens wagon must follow to remain upright <>
characters struggle with frustration over conflicts between their desires and their destinies <>
the performances are strong with all three of the principal players chow yeoh and zhang conveying the burdens of living expected lives in expected ways <>
for an actionfilled film theres a lot going on above the neck <>
{-1} thats quite a load for an adventure film to carry and occasionally its not quite up to the task <>
crouching tiger is full of subplots that make it denser than it needs to be functionally dashing from jens encounter with a desert raider chen chang to the political implications of the swords disappearance to the soontobeirrelevant roles of a police officer and his daughter <>
particularly underdeveloped is the relationship between jen and her governess cheng peipei which ultimately plays a crucial role in the climax but feels like theres something missing <>
yet as ambitious as it is crouching tiger hidden dragon never feels selfimportant <>
as beautifully crafted as it is notably peter paus cinematography and tan duns score it never turns into a stagnant parade of lovely images <>
and as fanciful as its action sequences are they never inspire eyerolling <>
crouching tiger hidden dragon isnt a masterpiece but it doesnt have to be <>
theres pleasure enough in a film that doesnt make you feel stupid while it sends you soaring over the treetops <>

{0} in an early scene in thirteen days kenny o donnell kevin costner sits at the breakfast table with his wife and children <>
it is october and odonnell is a special advisor to president john f kennedy bruce greenwood <>
as the conversation turns to field trips and report cards alarm bells begin going off <>
not literal alarm bells for some civil defense drill metaphorical artistic alarm bells for viewers with a sense of deja vu <>
this is a film about the cuban missile crisis but here we are with a crewcut costner in his domestic glory <>
will thirteen days like jfk before it make the mistake of looking at a pivotal moment in american history and asking how did it affect kevin costners fictional family <>
{0} then for most of the film something wonderful happens we see no one but men in suits trying to solve a seemingly unsolvable problem <>
as tautly directed by roger donaldson thirteen days finds riveting drama in passionate debate tricky politics and impossible decisions at least until the odonnell kin start turning up again <>
most of the narrative is spent in the war rooms and strategy sessions that find jfk and his key advisors odonnell his brother and attorney general bobby steven culp secretary of defense robert mcnamara dylan baker trying to determine the appropriate course of action after spy planes identify soviet nuclear missile sites under construction in cuba just a couple of weeks away from being functional <>
do nothing and doomsday is a five minutes flight from half of america <>
try diplomacy and the sites become operational while offers and counteroffers take place <>
sneak in to attack the sites and the soviets retaliate in europe setting off a likely world war iii <>
{1} thirteen days is a historybased thriller that faces a variation on the knuckleheaded joke promulgated by the antititanic contingent in this case we know the boat or the human race doesnt sink <>
but thirteen days isnt about whether or not the world will be bombed to cinders its about the astonishing reallife war game played by capable but flawed people for the fate of civilization <>
for a film that is devoted largely to debate and description of scenarios thirteen day is incredibly tense <>
we watch politicians go toetotoe with soldiers over the appropriate philosophical footing for dealing with the red menace <>
we watch brinksmanship played like two kids shoving each other on a schoolyard <>
its the kind of smart filmmaking of ideas that can keep you on the edge of your seat waiting for a phone to ring or not to ring <>
{2} mostly however its a profile in the courage under fire of john f kennedy <>
plenty of films have opted either to canonize jfk as our great slain king or demonize him as a womanizing rich kid but i dont think any film has ever made him as compelling a dramatic character <>
as played with a piercing intellect by bruce greenwood kennedy is portrayed as an often shorttempered man with burdens to bear the subtle acknowledgement of his chronic back pain is one of many effective shorthands in david selfs script <>
hes also the essence of a great leader bringing the finest minds together considering the greatest possible good and finally trusting his own reason and judgment <>
greenwoods dynamic performance finds jfks legacy not in some legend of golden boy heroism but in the idea that he carried out his responsibilities with character <>
{-1} all is exceedingly well in thirteen days until the story begins drifting back to odonnell fretting over his loved ones <>
costner is a muchmaligned dramatic actor and he doesnt do himself favors here with a honking boston accent thats borderline absurd next to the subtler intonations of greenwood and culp as scary a dead ringer for rfk as you could imagine <>
when one scene after another in the final half hour of thirteen days finds costner staring pensively at one of his children sharing a quiet moment with his wife or rubbing his tightlyclosed eyes it becomes too easy to lose focus on the big picture for some misguided sense of humanizing the story <>
there are plenty of dramatically fascinating humans in thirteen days without ever leaving the closed conference rooms of the white house and the pentagon <>
policy can make surprisingly intense cinema without a breakfast table or report card in sight <>

{0} in waterford vermont the town doctor strolls down main street following up with his patients as they pass by <>
the residents exchange expressions of support for the high school football team and the clothing store leaves racks untended on the sidewalk <>
the mayor is even named george bailey <>
george fortheloveofits a wonderful life bailey <>
yes indeed waterford is the quintessence of wholesome smalltown america god bless us every one <>
{0} oh and there was a string of suspicious fires back in the s probably set by a deranged teenager <>
{0} somewhere between frank capra and david lynch by way of woody allen lies the world of david mamets state and main a movie industry satire thats not really a movie industry satire in its unique sweetly cynical way <>
the concept finds a hollywood film crew searching for the ideal backwater new england town for a location shoot <>
director walt price william h macy believes he has found his spot in waterford until things start getting shaky <>
a key location is inconveniently absent leading man bob barrenger alec baldwin is once again indulging his taste for underage girls and leading lady claire wellesley sarah jessica parker is balking at doing her nude scene <>
meanwhile the films rookie screenwriter joseph turner white philip seymour hoffman is struggling with his artistic conscience and his rewrites as he falls for local bookseller annie white rebecca pidgeon <>
{1} in a more conventional film state and main would have turned into a broad fishoutofwater farce about clashes between the worldly and the homespun <>
mamet chooses to keep those two worlds largely distinct from a narrative standpoint juxtaposing the films behindthescenes chaos with the reactions of the townspeople to the crews presence <>
most of the more straightforward humor comes from the preproduction with good selfdeprecating work by baldwin and parker and hilarious work by david paymer as the films cutthroat producer <>
then there is macy whose director takes on a different personality for every person he deals with depending on how much power he wields over them <>
as both writer and director mamet keeps masterful control over when information is revealed adding layers of humor at unexpected moments <>
in their clockwork construction and delightful aura of selfimportance those movie scenes are the stuff of great comedy <>
{0} but state and main actually works best as something more than a simple razzing of movie folk <>
the real object of mamets ridicule is the whole idea of purity over which black obsessess in his script <>
waterford is no idealized hamlet away from the hustle and bustle of hollywood <>
its a town with dark secrets ready to sell its soul for a chance to be part of that hustle and bustle <>
the townies at the diner trade their local paper for variety the mayors wife patti lupone tears up her historic home to host a dinner for the film crew and the community theater actors drop their local production for a chance to be an extra in the movie <>
mamet takes the myth of pop culture as corruptor of ordinary decent americans and shows ordinary decent americans in our tabloid and wwfobsessed average american world plenty ready to be corrupted if given an excuse thank you very much <>
{-1} that may sound like a terribly dark perspective but state and main is actually a bit more optimistic <>
the budding romance between black and white is not just significant in the metaphorical obviousness of their names but in showing how tough it is to maintain a moral center in any environment <>
its also unfortunately a seriously weak link <>
its nice to see an actor like hoffman get a shot at a romantic lead but theres something missing from his character to make him a solid center <>
and while pidgeon is getting better on screen all the time she still slips into the most jarring examples of clipped mametspeak <>
state and main hits its own giant pothole like the one the town continues to ignore but unlike in the film it never gets big enough to cause a wreck <>
mamets script is too sharp the performances too strong and the message too cleverly insinuated <>
good comedy is rare good comedy with something to say is even rarer <>
welcome to waterford a little slice of america the way it used to be and the way it really is <>

[26790/2]
{-1} back in the late s and early s burt reynolds started making movies that generally appeared to be cast parties committed to celluloid <>
most notably in the cannonball run films burt and a bunch of his pals apparently got together and decided wouldnt it really be great if we took enormous amounts of a studios money and then just got together and screwed around for a couple of hours <>
the result was the kind of film where it was obvious that everyone in the movie was having loads and loads of fun <>
viewers on the other hand generally found the experience about as much fun as having the cars in the film back up repeatedly over the base of their skulls <>
{0} in little nicky adam sandler decides to hold a reunion for all his former saturday night live castmates and cronies only he forgot to bring a script <>
or anything funny to do <>
or anything to counteract the typically yk gratuitous crudeness that makes you want to swear off ever seeing movies again <>
the premise finds sandler cast as nicky the milquetoast son of the devil harvey keitel <>
dear old dad has recently decided that hes not ready to give up the throne to one of his progeny which angers nickys nastier brothers adrian rhys ifans and cassius tom tiny lister <>
nickys satanic siblings flee to the world above determined to create a hell on earth perhaps by financing additional adam sandler movies <>
this development threatens to upset the balance between good and evil or something to that effect so nicky must go retrieve his brothers and make out with patricia arquette and do a featurelength commercial for popeyes chicken before daddy devil disintegrates into a pile of special effectsgenerated body parts <>
{-2} lets leave aside for a moment the fact that little nicky is based on the morally itchy proposition that were expected to root for the survival of the devil <>
theres plenty more repugnant stuff in little nicky that may make you wish you too were disintegrating into a pile of special effectsgenerated body parts ideally without any sensory apparatus to take in the film itself <>
sure we could all just chuckle about it and shake our heads ruefully about the increasing popularity of such moron movies <>
that would mean giving a pass to ostensible gags based on children getting drunk and vomiting dogs humping jabs at a guy perhaps being gay various bodily fluids a pair of comic relief satanworshipers a demon with a huge pair of breasts on his head and hitler getting his daily punishment of large objects shoved up his rectum <>
please somebody throw me a pair of knee pads cause theyre aching from where im slapping them <>
{-2} of course adam sandler fans would likely consider such a sarcastic dismissal the whining of an outoftouch guy who just doesnt get how brilliantly hysterical sandler is <>
and such a predictable view might be remotely defensible if not for the fact that sandler himself is reduced to the status of straight man for most of the film <>
little nicky finds sandler mugging and doing the requisite silly voice yet generally shrinking into the background while his supporting characters toss out the lame punch lines <>
like the good host he defers to his snl buddies carvey lovitz nealon schneider writer robert smigel as the voice of mr beefy the bulldog cast members from previous films allen covert peter dante jonathan loughran and even harvey keitel and quentin tarantino <>
this is a film that asks you to laugh harder at a performance by quentin tarantino than a performance by adam sandler <>
if you need to know anything more to keep you away your soul is already lost <>
{-1} little nicky finds a brief spark of life late in the film when reese witherspoon turns up as an angel in a heaven thats more like a sorority house <>
the gags about giggling cherubim are at least moderately amusing and witherspoon continues to show the comic chops that made her so good in election <>
but little nicky can never get past the vibe that the whole thing was an excuse for sandler to give work to his friends so they could riff on the set <>
you dont need to waste time being outraged by a film about a hero from hell or by its stupidity and crass humor <>
you can save all your outrage for the idea that adam sandler is asking you to for your ticket dollars to finance his highconcept hot tub party <>

[26608/8]
{1} sentimentalized stories of the s have become so commonplace in film that its incredibly refreshing to find one that doesnt whitewash the darker side of the happy days <>
raymond defelittas two family house is in some ways a familiar feelgood story but it gives its good feeling an unexpected edge <>
the storys protagonist is buddy visalo michael rispoli a world war ii veteran living in a predominantly italian staten island neighborhood in <>
buddy once had dreams of being a singer but those dreams were overwhelmed by his wife estelles katherine narducci desire for a normal life <>
while buddy works in a local factory he still strives for something more and jumps at the chance to purchase a rundown two story house that he and estelle can occupy upstairs while turning the downstairs into a tavern <>
unfortunately the upstairs is already occupied by jim oneary kevin conway and his pregnant wife mary kelly macdonald who are in no hurry to leave and have an obscure tenancy law on their side <>
{0} for a while two family house looks like it might turn into a broad comedy with the italians and irish clashing loudly and perhaps farcically <>
then on the day buddy is prepared to throw the onearys out mary gives birth to an unexpectedly ahem darkhued child and jim abandons her <>
the somewhat guilty buddy puts mary and her child up in a nearby apartment and the two begin spending time together while estelle continues to scoff at buddys attempts at entrepreneurship <>
in fact shes scoffing at even more than that as are buddys friends in a slightly different way <>
what is ridiculous to them is the idea of anyone moving too far beyond the proscribed ethnic cultural and even geographic boundaries <>
buddys willingness to extend a hand to mary just like his desire to pursue a career dream suggests that the boundaries are a bit blurry <>
and the idea of blurry boundaries makes everyone around buddy more than slightly uncomfortable <>
{2} even without its subtext two family house is a funny wellacted and tremendously appealing drama so appealing that it might even be perceived as fantastically generous to its protagonist <>
rispoli delivers a nicely nuanced performance as buddy a teddy bear of a guy trying to move forward rather than look back in bitterness at missed opportunities or failures <>
defelittas brand of nostalgia includes the recognition that most of his characters are racists they toss around slurs with the casual understanding that in their homogenous world theres us and them <>
it would be easy to interpret buddys openmindedness as anachronism but defelitta doesnt make him the good guy just because he helps the girl with the black baby nor are estelle and buddys friends obvious villains just because they use the nword <>
two family house builds its characters by building a complete understanding of the world around them <>
{1} defelitta does go a bit overboard in his use of voiceover narration told by marys son from a distance of forty years and the film does drag as it moves past the minute mark <>
it occupies that treacherous middle ground between comedy and drama where a film can either feel too frivolous or not frivolous enough <>
fortunately defelitta understands how to make his film about more than its obvious premise without resorting to overlyweighty symbolism <>
culture clashes tend to be represented on screen either in strident sociology lectures or fishoutofwater yukfests <>
two family house explores melting pot growing pains in the context of a simple story about a simple man <>
its an achievement thats not nearly as simple as it looks <>

[26544/2]
{-1} lost souls has been on the shelf at new line for over a year since its originally scheduled release date last fall <>
the official story was that it was pushed back to avoid the slew of similarlythemed films slated for the pseudoend of the millennium end of days stigmata <>
in order to avoid comparisons and find an open market for a film about demonic possession and exorcism they waited and waited until october the day the successful rerelease of the exorcist went nationwide <>
so much for avoiding comparisons <>
{-2} lost souls isnt just bad because its not as good as the exorcist <>
its bad because its yet another exercise in moody production values supporting an utterly weightless story <>
winona ryder stars as maya larkin a young woman working on the catholic churchs equivalent of the xfiles <>
once upon a time she was saved from a demonic possession by father ledeaux john hurt now she works with him and his associates on other exorcisms <>
but the granddaddy of all possessions is on the horizon maya has discovered the identity of the man who will become the antichrist a bestselling nonfiction writer named peter kelson ben chaplin <>
kelson himself has no idea that he may be part of a dark plan but maya is determined to clue him in even if it means going toetotoe with evil with a capital e <>
{-1} gifted cinematographer janusz kaminski who worked with steven spielberg on schindlers list and saving private ryan makes his directing debut with lost souls and he trots out plenty of visual goodies to tart up the proceedings <>
unfortunately theyre the sort of visual goodies that just make you chuckle at their obviousness <>
there are ominous slowmotion shots of maya and her associates heading towards an exorcism like an ecclesiastical crew of reservoir dogs <>
there are jagged edits and lowangle shots intended to evoke evil through obscurity <>
and there are plenty of shots of slowlydripping water which apparently has become the standardissue portent of satanic antics <>
on exactly one occasion kaminskis freaky imagery evokes a shiver <>
for the other minutes of lost souls it evokes a sense of desperation <>
{-2} and its no wonder hes desperate considering the script hes working with <>
its one thing for a film about the prince of darkness to be melodramatic or overwrought or even silly <>
its quite another for it to be an outright bore <>
lost souls is an incredibly monotonous experience never once working up a really good scare or a palpable sense of unease <>
it doesnt develop anything resembling momentum towards a satisfyingly harrowing conclusion which makes it alltooeasy to dwell on the sluggishly paced expository scenes <>
ryder spends the film looking vaguely tormented while chaplin spends the film looking puzzled and then vaguely tormented and theres no reason whatsoever to care about either one of them <>
it sometimes seems that every part of lost souls that could have inspired a genuinely visceral reaction has been edited out leaving an indistinct morass of gloomy cinematography in its stead <>
{-2} occasionally lost souls shakes itself from its comainducing torpor just long enough to be aggressively dumb <>
the hilarious climax comes as peters car radio clock ticks down to his transformation suggesting not only that the apocalypse will be filmed like a scene from speed but that peter conscientiously synchronized his clock that morning to hell mean time <>
at the very least such foolishness provides a distraction the rest of lost souls cant be bothered with <>
theres no excuse for a movie about the primal forces of evil to make satans influence seem so banal <>
twentyfive years have passed since the exorcist was first released and its still a jolt to the system <>
lost souls could have remained on new lines shelf for another twentyfive years and no one would have missed it <>

{0} as is probably the case for many of my worldly generation my defining image of tammy faye bakker isnt even really of tammy faye bakker <>
its the image of saturday night lives jan hooks doing tammy faye all squeaky rebuking of demons and freely flowing mascara <>
tammy faye herself was a caricature easy to mock because of that heartonthesleeve demeanor and that garishly madeup face on that tiny body <>
who knew who she really was and frankly who cared <>
she was part of that whole ptl scandal with its juicy melange of god sex and fraud <>
and she was so easy to laugh at <>
{1} randy barbato and fenton baileys documentary the eyes of tammy faye is clearly an attempt to rehabilitate tammy faye nowmessners image made with the full cooperation of the first lady of televangelism <>
and its a frequently fascinating character study that puts a truly human face on the muchmaligned woman <>
after an introduction to tammy fayes childhood much of the film is devoted to the peaks and valleys in jim and tammy faye bakkers multiple attempts to create a christianthemed satellite television network <>
naturally theres also a heavy focus on the scandal that toppled the bakkers ptl empire including jims confession to a onenight stand with jessica hahn and a fraud trial related to fundraising for the heritage usa vacation resort <>
along the way there are glimpses at the presentday tammy starting over once again with a marriage to former bakker associate roe messner and attempting to put her troubled past behind her <>
{1} the eyes of tammy faye is full of the sort of eyeopening tidbits that make a documentary more than a parade of facts places and dates <>
barbato and bailey give the bakkers their due as pioneers who started the club trinity broadcasting and ptl before being forced out of each and every one by savvier folks <>
there are funny archival clips of the bakkers mostlyimprovised christian childrens show with tammy faye performing hand puppets and surprising glimpses of tammy faye reaching out to aids patients at a time when many religious leaders were still referring to the disease as punishment for homosexuals <>
theres humor in the clips of a preoscar kevin spacey playing jim bakker in a madefortv movie and drama in the machinations of jerry fallwell to force the bakkers out of ptl fallwell himself refused to be interviewed for the film <>
all documentaries should be this entertaining <>
{1} its also not clear until the film is nearly over that it has spent most of its running time avoiding its most intriguing subject the presentday tammy faye <>
once the whole sordid ptl mess had been laid out barbato and bailey shift gears to show tammy faye trying to revive her career as an entertainer <>
she appears on the nowdefunct roseanne talk show she meets with a photographer for new head shots and throws the makeup artist for a loop with her permanently lined lips eyes and eyebrows <>
she even pitches ideas for television projects including tammys terrific teens and a show about medical advances to an incredulous usa networks executive <>
tammy faye emerges as a wonderful contradiction a born performer whose years in the public eye have done nothing to erase her essential naivete <>
the goofy genuineness that emerges in scenes like her reaction to being in a grounded airplane during an electrical storm make for a much more human story than the story of the bakkers prescandal careers <>
{1} none of that makes the eyes of tammy faye any less worth watching in fact its almost like two provocative short films effectively fused together <>
its also playful the babeesque chorus of sock puppets reading the chapter titles informative and even a little bit inspirational <>
comic jim j bullock tammy fayes former daytime chatshow cohost claims that after the world ends all that will remain is roaches tammy faye and cher <>
its a treat getting to know that plucky survivor and learning that theres something more than someone elses caricature behind that trademark mascara <>

{1} some concepts are funny on paper even if theres no way they could ever be classic comedies in reality the crew has such a concept <>
is it funny envisioning a quartet of aging mob tough guys trying to regain their swagger in their sunset years sure it is <>
there have been other comedies about seniors turning to a life of crime rather than going gentle into that good night like the george burnsart carneylee strassburg vehicle going in style but a wiseguy twist sounds promising <>
it may not be chockablock with rapiersharp witticisms and there may be a prostate gag or two to wade through but there should be a few laughs right <>
theres only so much you can do to screw up a solid concept right <>
{-2} in fact the crew screws up its solid concept so badly and in so many provocative variations that its practically a road map for misbegotten filmmaking <>
the four aging mafiosi bobby bartellemeo richard dreyfuss joey bats pistella burt reynolds mike the brick donatelli dan hedaya and tony mouth donato seymour cassel are residents of a miami retirement hotel thats about to become the latest victim of south beach gentrification <>
faced with the prospect of a skyrocketing rent for their newlychic digs the boys decide to make their home a less appealing place to live by setting it up to look like a gangland murder has taken place there though the body they use is already dead <>
the fake hit has the desired effect of scaring off prospective tenants but theres an unfortunate side effect the dead body whose head they blew off was the father of a drug lord miguel sandoval whos determined to wreak vengeance on the responsible parties <>
{-1} ah the wacky complications that are possible with the inclusion of a pissedoff drug lord <>
and imagine how many more wacky complications are possible when you include a subplot involving a miami detective carrieanne moss trying to fend off the advances of her colleague and philandering exboyfriend jeremy piven <>
and still yet even how many more wacky complications are possible when a stripper jennifer tilly whos beginning to resemble divine above the neck learns of the boys involvement in the fake killing and blackmails them into killing her delicatessen heiress stepmother lainie kazan in full oy gevalt mode but the boys only kidnap her and fake her death instead only in so doing they manage to piss off the drug lord even further <>
can you feel your sides splitting at the crazy goofy hilarity <>
and can you feel a tear trickling down your cheek because bobby is really a sensitive guy searching high and low for the daughter he hasnt seen in years <>
{-1} the reason the crew stinks or at least the main reason is that its not about what its about <>
a movie about geriatric mobsters could be funny <>
you could have them interact with their modern counterparts to show them how its done old school like a scorsese version of space cowboys or focus on what kind of rackets they could run in their seniorheavy milieu <>
theres good character stuff there too what happens when youre left to fossilize after once being part of a culture of macho action <>
{-2} but the crew isnt about any of that <>
it isnt about anything really because theres so much garbage thrown into minutes of script that it never develops anything remotely resembling comic momentum <>
the personalities of the four principles are inanely simplistic leaving the actors to overact madly in compensation reynolds in particular is wretched beyond all description <>
director michael dinner meanwhile overdirects madly in compensation operating under the delusion that you can somehow make a terrible script funny by filming everyone in fisheye closeup <>
even the editing chops gags into such minute shreds that setups are separated from their punch lines <>
something this fundamentally incompetent should carry a government warning sticker <>
{-2} there are exactly two moments in the crew when the experience of watching it is remotely tolerable <>
one involves a silly homage to goodfellas with our protagonists strutting through the kitchen of a buffet restaurant after paying off a busboy <>
the other involves sandovals drug lord growing frustrated at dealing with his incompetent underlings <>
for the other minutes the crew isnt simply unfunny its a test of an audiences good will practically an exercise in making every wrong narrative performance or technical choice possible <>
its a good pitch turned into a terrible script turned into a godawful film <>
actual humor from a solid concept fuggeddaboutit <>

{0} jesus son is a film about addiction only its not really <>
the way were used to seeing films about addiction theres a message a lesson an agenda <>
drugs are bad the effects of drugs on users and their immediate circle of acquaintances are worse and our hero would be a perfectly happy and productive member of society if not for that thing he wouldnt just say no to <>
these tend to be films in which the ostensible messedup protagonist isnt really the center of the film <>
its the needle thats the center of the film or the bottle or the rolledup bill <>
addiction isnt just the theme its the star <>
{0} so lets rephrase that introduction jesus son is a film about fh billy crudup short for fhead a man who eventually becomes an addict <>
hes no angel even before his addiction however a loner who stumbles one day in the early s into a party where he meets michelle samantha morton <>
its michelle who eventually introduces him to the wonderful world of heroin and the two find themselves in a tumultuous relationship over the space of a few years <>
along the way fh has himself some crazy misadventures helping a drunken pal denis leary tear up a house for scrap wire sharing emergency room ordeals with a pillpopping orderly jack black and so on <>
then michelle leaves him setting him down the difficult road to sobriety <>
{1} actually michelle has already left him when jesus son begins which is typical of the frisky zigzagging approach taken in adapting denis johnsons collection of short stories <>
fh narrates his story with all the straightahead narrative lucidity youd expect of a perpetually stoned guy he riccochets back and forth in time picking up one thread of the story in the middle of another story when he recalls something hes forgotten to tell us <>
director alison maclean and her trio of writers give jesus son a playfulness thats entertaining even as it never shies away from the darkest sides of addiction <>
in one scene a romantic song plays while the camera tracks slowly toward a motel room bed to reveal not a lovers embrace but fh helping michelle fix in another a split screen reveals the alternate fates of two characters who have both taken the same bad drugs <>
its a film with the wonderfully scrambled logic of drug use itself <>
{2} but in case you missed the caveat this is not exactly a film about addiction <>
billy crudup gives a magnetic performance as fh a peripatetic loser who has been given that derogatory nickname even before he ever picks up a needle <>
in fact his mutually selfdestructive relationship with michelle is portrayed as a strangely stabilizing influence in his fragmented life <>
crudup finds a cohesiveness to fhs character through the episodic film and even manages to keep up with jack blacks scenestealing orderly in the films most hilarious segments <>
jesus son works not because the individual scenes are so effective though they are or because the portrayal of addiction is so grimly affecting because it is not but because fh is a great anchor for a film that heads in so many different directions <>
{1} perhaps inevitably jesus son eventually turns to the subject of fhs attempts to get straight and its a bit depressing that the film loses so much steam once drugs are no longer involved <>
the individual moments fhs fascination with a menonite woman a conversation with an aging fellow patient in rehab dennis hopper a relationship with a member of his support group holly hunter feel more isolated and it begins to appear that theres no end in sight <>
perhaps the comedown is relative after such a wonderful first hour perhaps theres nothing for an episodic film to do but find a somewhat arbitrary place to stop <>
even the sluggish conclusion cant diminish the surprising darkly comic experience of jesus son however <>
even once fh is clean there are still problems for him to deal with how refreshing to see addiction take a back seat to the addict to see the needle in its appropriate place as supporting player <>

{0} i think its fair to say that ive been looking forward to a film version of xmen for a while now somewhere in the neighborhood of years as a matter of fact <>
xmen was one of the first comic books i ever bought and it launched me on a love affair with the medium that abated only when as a college student i could no longer afford my habit <>
some readers may suspect that this history would lead me to go easy on an adolescent fanboy <>
personally i thought it would make me much tougher <>
after all a year wait can do something to ones expectations <>
i didnt think id settle for anything less than the kind of comic book adaptation you almost never see one that combines rousing heroic action with a solid story <>
{2} to my joy and astonishment thats exactly what i got <>
xmen is not just a great comic book movie its actually a pretty good movie period <>
for those unfamiliar with the source material the xmen are mutants humans with unusual powers that manifest themselves during puberty <>
telepathic mutant professor charles xavier patrick stewart has dedicated himself to helping mutants learn to cope with their powers at his school for gifted youngsters mutants like retractable clawwielding wolverine hugh jackman and a teenager called rogue anna paquin who absorbs the life force of people she touches <>
xavier also has a powerful adversary in magneto ian mckellen who sees mutants as destined for superiority and who believes the mass of humanity fears and hates mutantkind <>
it seems magnetos perspective is justified when us senator robert kelly bruce davison begins advocating for mutants to register with the government <>
and when magneto and his brotherhood of mutants set in motion a plan to mutate all of humanity you can bet that a battle with xaviers xmen is not far off <>
{2} the xmen universe has grown pretty unwieldy over the years but director bryan singer the usual suspects and his team of writers wisely keep the focus on a limited number of characters team leader cyclops james marsden telekinetic jean grey famke janssen and weather manipulator storm halle berry <>
even more wisely he focuses primarily on wolverine and his paternal relationship with the fragile frightened rogue <>
that choice not only gives the story an emotional anchor it gives plenty of screen time to xmens most intriguing character and easily its best performance <>
youve probably never seen australian actor hugh jackman before though he resembles a brawnier gary sinise but you will see him again because the guy has charisma to burn <>
jackman offers everything a fan could hope for in a portrayal of wolverine from the trademark muttonchops to the genuine sense of mystery and menace <>
if xmen had nothing else going for it but jackman it would still be worth seeing <>
{2} the wonderful thing is that xmen does have more going for it <>
drawing on one of the comics best stories of the s xmen effectively uses the subtext of antimutant hysteria as a combination of red scare theres a great moment in a senate debate in which kelly waves around a list of names of known mutants racism and homophobia <>
it offers dozens of insider gags for the xmen faithful while avoiding the slavish devotion to every detail that can interfere in solid film storytelling <>
and just in case it matters to anyone it offers some of the kickassinest action scenes this side of the matrix <>
the climactic battle between the xmen and the brotherhood including shapeshifter mystique rebecca romijnstamos tongueflicker toad ray park and bonecrusher sabretooth tyler mane is simply superb <>
the fact that you dont have to wade through minutes of junk to get to it is a wonderful bonus <>
{-1} of course xmen has its flaws <>
theres not much for halle berry to do but look intense when her eyes go white which is probably all for the best given the incredible disappearing accent she occasionally employs <>
the script also doesnt do quite enough with turning magneto into a genuinely tragic villain especially given the amount of time devoted to his backstory in the prologue <>
its always tough for a film like xmen to lay the foundation while still delivering the goods so its inevitable that there are going to be some lulls and loose ends <>
i was startled however by how few there were <>
maybe my inner adolescent fanboy did emerge during xmen but it emerged because the film reminded me of the best the comic book had to offer as well as some of the best an action film can offer <>
i think it was worth the wait though i have a sneaking suspicion it wont be years before the xmen hit the screen again <>

{0} pulpnoir is tough to pull off in this era of selfreferential hipness <>
strangely enough pulpnoir satire may be even tougher to pull off since the entire genre itself fairly reeks of selfparody every time a hardboiled guy a hardboiled situation and hardboiled voiceover dialogue combine on screen <>
now take that pulpnoir satire and base it on a real pulp novel and youve got the potential for a smug disaster <>
the woman chaser shouldnt work <>
it couldnt work <>
{2} writerdirector robinson devor had the recipe for yet another inert genre parody in his hands but somehow he turned it into something so wonderfully warped its almost impossible to resist <>
based on the novel of the same name by charles willeford the woman chaser stars patrick warburton erstwhile seinfeld david puddy as richard hudson a used car dealer recently returned to his hometown of los angeles circa <>
richard unexpectedly finds himself experiencing an existential crisis overwhelmed by the need to abandon sales and create something of lasting value <>
he therefore sets out to write and direct his own film a gritty drama about an alienated trucker <>
with the help of his stepfather leo paul malevitz a washedup former filmmaker richard gives the sales pitch of his life and finds his project picked up by mammoth studios <>
but he could be in for hard lessons about the biz <>
{2} if the above summary sets you to puzzling over the films title fear not <>
in the s and s willeford wrote within a genre where publishers couldnt care less what was inside the cover so long as a broad in a tight sweater and a provocative title were on the cover <>
the author took advantage of that freedom to write unconventional stories like the one that inspired the alec baldwin vehicle miami blues as well as the woman chaser originally titled the director <>
robinson devor uses willefords own offbeat sensibility as a launching pad then turns the woman chaser into such a twisted combination of subversion and homage that you can only ride along where it takes you <>
devor nails the genre atmosphere helped greatly by kramer morgenthaus marvelous blackandwhite a la kiss me deadly cinematography and warburtons noteperfect narration <>
parody only seems to work when its inspired by genuine affection and devor clearly loves film noir mannered conventions and all <>
{2} he also figures out that his story is a way to give a fresh twist to the trite independent film premise of making an independent film <>
from richards intense pitch of his films concept to his unconventional methods of eliciting performances to his obsession with the perfect edited length of his film the woman chaser finds a kick for every predictable situation <>
devor even scripts the most trenchant line ive ever heard on the phenomenon of people assuming they can write a film richard during his quest for an artistic outlet sculpture and architecture require years of training and practice but a screenplay <>
taking the concept out of the present day filmmaking world gives it the perfect touch of the surreal without even the faintest hint of the superior outsider attitude that too often hinders movies about making movies <>
{1} not all the quirkiness in the woman chaser works of course <>
there are ebbs in devors pacing and a narrative that doesnt always hang together except as a showcase for warburtons tremendously entertaining performance <>
yet even then theres entertainment value in virtually every aborted narrative thread <>
and youve got to love a film that launches the bearish warburton on a barechested ballet or lands him in bed with a something salvation army volunteer <>
its too easy to praise a film simply for being different but the woman chaser is different in all the right ways <>
its energetic and imaginative where other parodies are too often limp and witless <>
it skewers the ego of filmmakers but never loses its love for filmmaking <>
it even pokes fun at film noir without resorting to predictable gags the woman chaser is a surprise in every positive sense of the word because really it shouldnt work <>

{1} its a terrible habit of mine that i often find myself watching nonenglish language films throught he lens of how would hollywood screw this up <>
aside from the implied inherent superiority of all things subtitled theres the strange problem of comparing a film im watching to a film that hasnt even been made but which in my head is a dire experience indeed <>
a film cant help but seem glorious under such conditions though it doesnt help the discussion of the film on its own merits <>
i was doing a pretty good job of avoiding the hypothetical comparison in zhang yimous not one less until a curious thing happened in its final fifteen minutes it started to turn into its own hollywood incarnation <>
thank heaven its so good for so long that the strange twist cant spoil the experience <>
{0} using actors whose own names become the names of his characters zhang tells the story of the rural chinese village of shuixian and its unique educational problems <>
shuixians only teacher gao enman is leaving on a monthlong sabbatical to care for his ill mother obliging mayor tian zhenda to bring in a substitute from a neighboring village <>
the new teacher is wei minzhi a yearold whos the only person willing to take the job <>
wei is only in it for the yuan shes been promised and is eager for the yuan bonus gao promises her if he returns to find the same students in his rapidly dwindling class <>
then class troublemaker zhang huike leaves for beijing to help his family pay off its debts sending wei on her own quest to bring huike back to the village <>
{1} the impressive thing about both zhangs direction and shi xiangshengs script based on his account of his experience as a rural teacher is how gradually and unobtrusively weis character develops <>
shes pretty unsympathetic at the outset utterly unqualified for her post effective primarily at playing goalkeeper at the schoolroom door but not at all troubled about demanding her money <>
when huike leaves shes so singleminded about getting him back to guarantee her bonus that she takes her class on a field trip that essentially amounts to slave labor moving bricks to earn the money for bus fare <>
the cleverly handled scenes of wei leading the class in math problems with very realworld implications make for a solid foundation but its only when wei heads into the city that her quest becomes more selfless <>
the amount of time she devotes to ensuring the welfare of one student although initially for selfish reasons turns her into a real teacher <>
{-1} weis quest and the growing she does along the way make for a thoroughly compelling narrative but zhang has sociopolitical fish to fry as well <>
as not one less draws to a close the story becomes a statement about the plight of chinas rural poor including the deteriorating conditions of schools and the flight of students to help support their families <>
theres a funny bit in which a thoroughly terrified wei goes on television to help the search for huike but it leads to a sentimentalized ending in which the troubles of the shuixian school become a media sensation <>
a film crew rolls into town accompanied by plenty of donated school supplies and the children end up gathered around wei in an uplifting to her with love climax while a scrolling message dutifully informs us about the reallife conditions in rural chinese schools <>
its still a satisfying resolution but its excessively underlined <>
its the way hollywood films too often try to convince an audience theyve not just watched an enjoyable film but also become more compassionate betterinformed citizens of the world <>
{0} the frustrating part is that its so unnecessary <>
virtually from the outset the financial conditions of the school become an effective part of the drama youd never expect a film to wring such tension from a student stepping on the schools morepreciousthangold chalk supply <>
the rookie actors are raw but do a more than serviceable job of performing their own lives <>
in short not one less does everything a film needs to do to draw you into its world and into the characters inhabiting that world <>
when it resorts to a messageheavy happy ending it suddenly feels like another sort of film entirely <>
for a thankfully brief moment i saw a glimpse of the massmarket crowdpleaser that might have been <>
its a reminder of how much more pleasing a film can be when it sticks to simpler truths <>

{0} in a lifespan of just over months the sex pistols managed to distill the entire history of rock and roll into one shortlived phenomenally influential experiment <>
there were internal disagreements and lineup changes <>
there were distractions from meddling girlfriends and drugs <>
there were legal and fiscal wranglings with a shady manager and anxious record companies <>
there were cries of outrage from adults who just didnt understand the rebellious messages of this new musical form accompanied by the certain knowledge that civilization as we knew it was about to come to an end <>
and finally there was the inevitable transformation of rebellion and singularity into its own kind of conformity <>
{1} anyone at all familiar with the pistols would hope to high heaven that a filmmaker wouldnt choose to tell their story in the measured tones of hero worship <>
no such worries under the direction of julien temple who turns the filth and the fury into a multimedia sex pistols assault <>
temple frames his archival footage of the band with modern day interviews with the bands four original members vocalist john johnny rotten lydon guitarist steve jones drummer paul cook and bassist glen matlock and a post breakup interview with replacement bassist and eventual heroin casualty sid vicious <>
their voices describe a band born out of the social conditions of mids england a music of furious discontent that made the sex pistols as reviled by their critics as they were adored by their fans <>
they also tell of the factions within the band between those loyal to the pistols manager and selfdescribed creator malcolm mclaren and those who distrusted his business dealings and staged outrageousness <>
{2} many of the stories told in the filth and the fury are by now the stuff of rock legend the profane appearance on an english television show the performance of god save the queen on the thames during the celebration of queen elizabeths silver anniversary jubilee the onesongandout final concert at san franciscos winterland in january <>
julien temple has already documented the sex pistols in s the great rock n roll swindle so there was the danger that the filth and the fury would feel not just like a canonization of a pioneering band but a recycled canonization <>
instead temple captures not just the energy of the pistols but their satirical sense of playfulness as well <>
that expletivefilled television interview is described as a drunken steve jones having fun at the expense of the equally drunk host jabs at progressive rock contemporaries like yes and emerson lake and palmer are accompanied by footage of stopmotion dinosaurs <>
with music animation and dozens of archival clips temple compiles a film that doesnt merely lay out a sex pistols chronology it captures the atmosphere and the attitude of anarchy in the uk <>
{-1} thats not to say that its instantly reliable as the definitive sex pistols story <>
swindle may have been an obvious attempt at selfcongratulation by mclaren but the filth and the fury occasionally seems just as much like an ego piece for johnny rotten <>
the presentday interviews are conducted with the band members in shadow an effective means of keeping the story in the present of s england <>
they also allow rotten in particular to set the record straight in a manner that sounds theatrically performed every time he opens his mouth <>
rotten may very well be a more reliable historian of the pistols than mclaren but when he and jones relate differing accounts of a hotel room snafu its hard not to here rottens version as a bit of overdramatization <>
make no mistake its still tremendously interesting listening to rottens perspective on the rise and fall of the band <>
its also a little hard to take when he actually begins crying over the tragic end of his friend sid vicious <>
{2} thats actually a fairly minor quibble with a film as vital and generally unpretentious as the filth and the fury you dont get less pretentious than steve jones crudely honest reason for wanting to be in a band <>
while temple clearly appreciates the sex pistols as the defining force in english punk including footage of youngsters siouxsie sioux billy idol and pogues frontman shane mcgowan at concerts or singing pistols songs he also confronts the bands members dissatisfaction with how their legacy has been defined <>
rotten in particular bemoans punk being absorbed back into the mainstream with middleclass kids wearing leather the real early english punks could never have afforded <>
hes also surprisingly philosophical about the bands disintegration during its us tour <>
the sex pistols had to end when it did rotten opines but it didnt have to end how it did <>
of course he probably would be less concerned with the philosophizing than pure sensory jolt and thats something the filth and the fury provides <>
it took the sex pistols two years to distill rock and roll into every one of its basic elements <>
it takes julien temple minutes to do the same thing to the sex pistols <>
its a story with the frantic twoandahalfminute raw energy blast of a classic punk anthem <>

{1} in an everchanging world theres something understandably comforting about the impressive sameness of jerry bruckheimer productions <>
going back to his partnership with the late don simpson bruckheimer has built an impressive year resume of box office successes beverly hills cop top gun bad boys the rock con air enemy of the state armageddon <>
theres a formula to his films that has rarely let him down a formula that continues with nary a whiff of change in gone in sixty seconds <>
since this is a bruckheimer film you know you can count on <>
{0} a premise readymade for action <>
nicolas cage stars as randall memphis raines once the best booster in southern california now retired <>
hes dragged back into his old trade when his younger brother kip giovanni ribisi screws up while attempting to follow in his footsteps leaving nasty crime boss raymond calitri christopher eccleston with an attitude and a job still to be done <>
in order to save kips skin memphis agrees to fulfill kips contract stealing highend cars <>
unfortunately the delivery date is only three days away leaving memphis with little time to put together his crew and scout out the job all the while trying to avoid an old law enforcement nemesis delroy lindo whos breathing down his neck <>
{0} a style that transcends individual directors <>
it doesnt matter whether bruckheimers flavor of the month is tony scott michael bay simon west or sixty seconds helmer dominic sena his films all seem to look and sound exactly the same <>
perhaps its the fact that bruckheimer is attracted to directors whose background like his is in commercials and music videos making them likely to concur with his vision of glossy packaging <>
maybe he gets his people such great deals on orange lens filters that its impossible for those directors not to employ them for every single shot <>
whatever the reason the quickcuts bombastic musical scoring and burnished glow give bruckheimer films that certain grandiose flash that makes for action gold even if nothing else makes much sense because of <>
{-2} overstuffed scripts <>
in his recent efforts bruckheimer has shown a distinct inability to strip down an action story to its essentials <>
gone in sixty seconds is no exception dragging the pacing down by cramming too many characters into the narrative <>
that can result in absurd decisions like creating a solid vicious villain in eccleston then having his character disappear for literally minutes of the running time or similarly wasting the forceful presence of vinnie jones as memphis mute muscular associate <>
it also results in conflicts constructed with a fauxoperatic sense of consequence <>
the family tension between memphis and kip the nonsparks between memphis and his old flamerunning partner sway angelina jolie even the history between memphis and lindos determined detective bog the film down with a ridiculous sense that the story should be taken seriously when it should be a quick and dirty piece of crowdpleasing nonsense <>
those decisions are complicated for better and worse by <>
{-2} provocative casting <>
bruckheimer has shown himself to be a savvy packager of talent in recent years generally teaming up popular stars with established serious actors for a sense of credibility tom cruise and robert duvall in days of thunder will smith and gene hackman in enemy of the state cage with sean connery in the rock <>
cage and duvall are both back for gone in sixty seconds as is the characteristically diverse bruckheimer supporting cast <>
somehow it does make many of bruckheimers films feel less awful than they should that there are fairly talented actors involved cages descent into genre nonchalance notwithstanding <>
it also seems even more pathetic when they are stuck with scott rosenberg dialogue like hes bad hes real bad or how deep is he in deep or im not into the life any more <>
of course plenty of viewers will still lap it all up because it all comes coated in <>
{-2} buckets full of testosterone <>
eventually bruckheimer films do move albeit with a carefully constructed familiarity <>
the climactic car chase in sixty seconds is a competent piece of film work accentuated by senas fetishistic crosscutting to brakes and clutches and a car jump as aggressively improbable as anything since speed <>
its simply obvious that the whole film was constructed around that chase making me wish the filmmakers could be more honest about their intentions instead of lobbing a dozen pointless subplots at us <>
those who have enjoyed most of bruckheimers previous films arent likely to look disdainfully at this one because it goes nowhere different <>
its just another overblown sporadically diverting celebration of guy stuff <>
the names have changed but the orange filters remain the same <>

[24674/4]
{-1} having passed the year for which the designation sophomoric is named in the mids my perspective on a film like road trip is bound to be skewed <>
it is part of a grand tradition of leering sniggering comedies in which the antisocial behavior and hormonefueled idiocy of yearolds portrayed by yearolds are celebrated for the entertainment of yearolds <>
but i remember a time when such tales were sublimely crude animal house rather than ridiculously crude american pie when the goal was celebrating an anarchic spirit rather than seeing how much bodily fluid you could get away with in an rrated film <>
pushing the envelope farrelly brothersstyle can be fun stuffing the envelope to the point that it requires hundreds of dollars in postage can become a simple wearying exercise in can we get away with this <>
{0} if you belong to that demographic that finds a joke most appealing when its accompanied by a groan of disgust have we got a treat for you <>
road trip is framed as a tale of infamy told by a campus tour guide named barry tom green at the fictional university of ithaca <>
he tells of josh parker breckin meyer an earnest enough fellow in a longdistance relationship with a childhood sweetheart attending college in austin texas <>
when josh hooks up one night with beth amy smart and videotapes their tryst he thinks its a momentary lapse until he discovers that one of his roommates has mailed the tape to his girlfriend tiffany <>
soon josh and three pals libertine el seann william scott brilliant rubin paulo costanzo and geeky kyle dj qualls are on the road for austin racing the clock to get to the tape before tiffany returns to school from a family funeral <>
{0} i believe it should go without saying that the quartet takes a few detours before reaching texas <>
most of those detours involve the sacred duo of collegiate intemperance moodaltering substances and sex <>
theres a stop to make deposits at a sperm bank when they run out of money <>
theres a stop at a college where they end up partying with members of a black fraternity and where kyle loses his virginity to a corpulent woman <>
and theres an overnight stay with an elderly couple where the grizzled man of the house gets stoned and hallucinates a conversation with his dog <>
its a regular cornucopia of crudeness choreographed by director todd phillips with all the voyeuristic vigor he demonstrated when choreographing allegedly the outrageous antics in the staged allegedly documentary frat house <>
{-2} only its just not all that funny <>
unlike the pointlessly messagemongering american pie road trip never pretends to be anything more than a cesspool of moral depravity <>
its even refreshing in a twisted way that the girl who seduces josh inspiring the crosscountry recovery mission in the first place actually becomes the films heroine daring to suggest that sexually aggressive women can also be nice people <>
but road trips singularity of purpose doesnt translate into much manic energy <>
its lowbrow set pieces are pitched at obvious incongruities the pairing of railthin kyle with his substantial ladyfriend an old man sporting an obvious erection the macho el delighting in a prostate massage <>
theres not much of a sense of comic discovery to road trips gags theyre the gags teenagers are expected to laugh at <>
{-1} deserved kudos do go to tom green the mtv variety show hostcumcircus geek who plays the demented barry <>
greens act can be offputting but hes surprisingly funny as the perpetual undergrad with an unhealthy obsession with rubins pet python unleash the fury has already become part of my filmbased lexicon <>
his scenes are some of the only moments in road trip where you cant be sure exactly whats going to happen next <>
the rest of this trip meanders through some extremely familiar countryside and not familiar in a way that inspires fond comparisons to classic genre cousins <>
road trip is comedy a level removed from anything that could be really funny because its all about how funny the mere idea of a profane stoned dog could be <>
as the real classics of sophomoric humor have proved over the years even when it comes to grossouts execution is everything <>

{-2} battlefield earth is minutes long which is plenty long enough to spend watching a very bad film but i grew even more annoyed when i realized the film could have been at least minutes shorter therefore ending all our torment minutes sooner if someone had told director roger christian to stop using slow motion for every freaking action scene <>
{-2} lousy summer action films are nothing new <>
it is still a bit shocking however when you have the misfortune to stumble upon one so fundamentally inept even as grandiose adventure <>
battlefield earth is such a shambling behemoth a film not even bad enough to be funnybad at least not often enough <>
based on the novel by l ron hubbard it tells of an earth years after a conquering alien invasion by the profithungry psychlo race <>
bands of humans live primitive huntergatherer lives on the outskirts of the psychlo mining colony in denver while most humans work as slave labor <>
leading the psychlo security force is the arrogant terl john travolta embittered by his posting on earth and prepared to con his superiors out of a recentlydiscovered gold deposit <>
but hes about to meet his match in jonnie barry pepper a feisty human keen on leading a rebellion against the psychlos <>
{-2} ive never read the l ron hubbard novel on which battlefield earth is based so i dont know how much of the films narrative idiocy is his responsibility <>
i do know that the film could set you to scratching your head so furiously you could draw blood <>
how is it that in years of occupation strictly for the purpose of acquiring precious metals none of the psychlos bothered to investigate fort knox or noticed the big glowing vein of gold in the rocks a few miles from their headquarters <>
what miraculous change in the planets weather patterns allowed books in the denver library to survive years exposure to rocky mountain winters <>
and would it have been so hard to explain why the psychlos domed habitat is so strategically important when both humans and psychlos must wear breathing devices strangely like hightech breathe right strips in order to survive inside it <>
{-2} even with so much slipshod storytelling involved i might have settled for an actionadventure that seemed concerned about making its action somewhat adventurous <>
instead roger christian turns every confrontation every chase and every battle into parade of slowmotion explosions <>
the device has certainly become popular thanks to hong kong directors like john woo but in such cases the filmmaker is usually giving viewers the opportunity to appreciate a particularly cool stunt or chow yunfat flying through the air with a pair of guns blazing <>
christian on the other hand uses slowmotion to turn the film into an agonizing crawl towards its conclusion <>
its clear he wants battlefield earth to be something epic and mythological the frequent george lucas collaborator even uses the familiar wipedissolves from the star wars films <>
in christians hands unfortunately the wipes are yet another way he takes us far too slowly from one place to another <>
you know a film is failing on its most fundamental level when an entire sellout preview audience responds to the climactic explosion with stony silence <>
{-2} battlefield earth does offer the chance to watch travolta who has shown no reluctance to ham up his villainous characters in films like broken arrow and faceoff whooping it up as the gleefully duplicitous terl which occasionally makes the film watchable <>
sadly his gusto only makes it evident that someone involved in the film was actually trying to make it watchable <>
it certainly wasnt the casting director who chose as a protagonist the capable but uncharismatic pepper who may just be the separatedatbirth triplet sibling of skeet ulrich and johnny depp <>
it wasnt screenwriter corey mandell whose gifts for absurd plotting are rivaled only by his deft way with mangling dialogue and character development <>
and it wasnt roger christian who appears to have learned absolutely nothing about pacing from his work as second unit director with lucas <>
in his attempt to tell a saga of the year christian has chosen the sneaky trick of making the film so plodding that youll leave the theater wondering whether years have passed since you went in <>

{0} brian levant director of the flintstones in viva rock vegas as well as the flintstones feature says and does everything youd expect of a sequel to a film based on a television series <>
he professes his affection for the original series and his desire to remain true to its spirit <>
he tosses in touchstones both from the series the alien great gazoo harvey korman original gazoo voice in the role of wilmas father and from the first film rosie odonnell as the voice of an octopus masseuse <>
in short it is levants goal to create a thoroughly synthesized film experience <>
if anything in viva rock vegas disrupts the comfort of the familiar he has failed <>
{0} that being the case chalk up viva rock vegas as a smashing success of the most yawninducing sort <>
the prequel story begins with the great gazoo alan cumming assigned by his race to study the mating habits of prehistoric earthlings <>
he lands in bedrock where fred flintstone mark addy and barney rubble stephen baldwin are bachelor pals fresh out of the bronto crane academy <>
on a trip to the neighborhood bronto king they meet waitresses wilma slaghoople kristen johnston and betty oshale jane krakowski and romance is soon in the air <>
little do any of them know that wilma is actually a runaway heiress whose wouldbe fiance chip rockefeller thomas gibson is sort of a poor loser <>
chip invites the happy couples to his casino in rock vegas where his dastardly plans will be set in motion <>
{1} its somehow more depressing when a film like viva rock vegas shows flashes of genuinely inspired writing letting you know that those involved could have done much better if it had mattered at all to them <>
theres a great gag about circus sideshow freaks including a yearold man a wonderful hamfisted compliment with fred comparing wilmas eyes to two big eyes and an addled rock stars vague concern over whether his female companion is a minor <>
its also hard not to get a few giggles out of cummings doubleduty as the effete gazoo and the preening mick jagged <>
in general though the film is content to coast on its special effects its insider humor annmargret costar of the elvis presley film viva las vegas singing the title song and its brontocraneload of rock puns <>
handling such a recognizable commodity levant sees no need to rock no pun intended this particular boat <>
{0} of course he has no choice but to deal with a complete overhaul of the original films cast <>
john goodman gives way to addy whos personable enough and bypasses alan reeds fred entirely to go right to the source with a decent imitation of jackie gleason <>
the muscular baldwin isnt nearly as ideal a barney as rick moranis nor does johnston match elizabeth perkins endearingly flat readings of wilmas signature frad in neither case does the film waste any time explaining how each one shrinks several inches by the time the next film rolls around <>
only krakowski seems more physically right for her part god love rosie odonnell but shes no waspwaist and her titter is on target <>
theres not much one can say to criticize performances like these cartoonish would be a compliment after all but theres not much that distinguishes them either <>
the actors like most everything else in the film seem set up not to get in the way of the general feeling of good will <>
{-1} some might argue that a disposable entertainment like viva rock vegas is nothing more than brightlycolored slapstickheavy eye candy for the kids and should be treated as such <>
it might be easier to buy that reasoning if it didnt take exactly four minutes before the first flatulence joke and minutes for the first joke about fred and barney sheepishly denying the appearance of a homosexual relationship <>
i dont recall those as the kind of gags typical of the series for which brian levant expresses so much fond remembrance <>
the flintstones in viva rock vegas isolated bursts of genuine humor aside is a deeply pandering film <>
it panders to stereotypes it panders to the most inane adult nostalgia it panders to the most simplistic kiddie humor <>
thats often the kind of film you get when your primary goal is the comfort of the familiar in this case humor that was already tired when dinosaurs walked the earth <>

{-2} im not sure which would be more depressing if the makers of rules of engagement were simply exploiting soldiers for a gungho patriotic courtroom drama or if they actually believed they were doing justice to the complexities of warfare <>
the former would be a fairly typical case of hollywood opportunism a predictable but nonetheless annoying reduction of tangled moral issues to simple flagwaving absolutes <>
the latter would indicate good intentions gone horribly awry in the execution <>
you can figure out everything you need to know about how rules of engagement will approach its marine characters from the tag line on the poster set against a shot of samuel l jackson carrying a young boy to safety a hero should never have to stand alone <>
{1} from the setup theres reason to hope for and expect something more <>
a prologue set in vietnam introduces us to marines terry childers samuel l jackson and hays hodges tommy lee jones brothers in arms connected for life when childers helps save a wounded hodges life during battle <>
flash forward years where both men are colonels but childers is a commander while hodges is about to retire after three decades of military law desk work <>
but its hodges turn to come to childers rescue after a mission at the american embassy in yemen goes sour resulting in the deaths of people including women and children <>
though childers insists he was responding to gunfire from the protesters he faces a courtmartial for murder when evidence suggests he ordered the attack on civilians without provocation <>
its up to hodges as childers defense attorney to save his career <>
{0} thats fertile ground to explore the splitsecond lifeanddeath decisions involved in combat including the possibility that good soldiers can still make bad decisions based on emotional reaction <>
we see in the vietnam prologue that childers is capable of resorting to extreme acts under extreme circumstances leading to reasonable questions about his mental state and the mental state of any military commander <>
did the gunfire to which childers responded actually come from the jeering crowd below instead of just from the rooftop snipers above <>
is childers a hothead willing to commit murder to save his men <>
are such means justified by the ends of saving the lives of fellow soldiers <>
is there anything as blackandwhite as the notion of a hero where warfare is concerned <>
{-1} i refer you again to that tag line for the answer to the final question and by extension every other question the film could have raised <>
for you see there is no question about whether or not childers responded appropriately theres videotape evidence to prove that he did <>
theres also a nasty national security advisor bruce greenwood to hide and eventually destroy that videotape evidence creating an easy villain when a much more interesting villain would have been the chaos of combat itself <>
the painfully drawnout courtroom sequences might have been a place for exploring issues of how hairsplitting rules of engagement are interpreted when the bullets are flying <>
instead theyre a place to conclude that hodges is even a worse lawyer than he selfdeprecatingly calls himself since he never bothers to check the embassy building for the angle of entry of bullet holes <>
{-1} jones and jackson are of course talented actors whose intensity makes it easier to watch everything they do <>
its simply obvious from the first moments of rules of engagement that theyre not playing characters <>
rules of engagement is about as thoroughly plotdriven as movies get filled to its two hourplus rim with action exposition and testimony <>
its too busy being a melodrama to worry about ambiguity or nuance of character too busy appealing to viewers eager to root for our boys against the bureaucracy <>
in fact rules of engagement is so enamored with its own sense of doing justice to military men that it ends with the kind of postscript captions usually associated with factbased films just to let you know that those weasels in suits eventually got theirs <>
heroes will never have to stand alone <>
not as long as there are simpleminded crowdpleasers like rules of engagement to stand up for the idea that heroes are always right <>

his manner is so relaxed and his charisma so undeniable that its easy to forget how good he is at what he does if newman has ever mailed in a performance id like to know what it was <>
i find it hard not to get enthused about a caper film like where the money is when i know that newman is in the lead role <>
after all no actor has ever done a better job than newman of bringing life and charm to criminals butch cassidy the sundance kid cool hand luke brokendown hasbeens slap shot the verdict and slick hustlers the sting the color of money <>
worldweary intelligence fits him like spandex <>
{-1} its my sad duty to report that theres more weary than worldweary to where the money is though you can hardly blame newman for its failings <>
he plays henry manning a veteran bank robber who finds himself transferred from jail to a nursing home after he suffers a severe stroke <>
assigned to his care is carol ann mckay linda fiorentino a nurse and former prom queen whose life and marriage to former prom king wayne dermot mulroney never turned out like she hoped <>
then carol begins to suspect that henry has faked his stroke symptoms to get out of prison and eventually she forces henry to show his true colors <>
though henry thinks at first that carol plans to turn him in or blackmail him she actually has other plans in mind specifically she hopes henry will teach her the tricks of the thieving trade <>
{0} where the money is gets off to a kicky start with a flashback prologue of carol and wayne racing recklessly away from their prom set to the cars infectious hit you might think <>
the script coscripted by e max frye from his original story sets up carol as a live wire shorted out by routine and fiorentino does a more than capable job of giving her a spark shes one of the few actresses who approaches newman in the worldweary intelligence department <>
as the film peeks into carols marriage to wayne it begins to set up a character study of a woman driven to ridiculous lengths by the desire to add some excitement to her mundane life <>
{-2} and its a very very stupid idea <>
where the money is it should be reiterated has a caper at its core an armored car heist executed by henry carol and wayne <>
its an effective enough centerpiece but it has virtually nothing to do with the rest of the movie <>
in fact while the heist sequence is far from breathtaking in its execution director marek kanievska appears to have a philosophical objection to making the film interesting to watch on a minutetominute basis it only makes the central issue of carols midlife crisis seem utterly inconsequential <>
theres nothing wrong with adding some character to a plotdriven caper structure but thats not what where the money is does <>
it actually adds more plot in the form of waynes jealous streak carols attempts to help free henry etc <>
the film pretends its characterbased just long enough to distract from the main story then ties up everything so quickly you wonder if there were people involved at all <>
{-2} the horrible consequence of this approach is that newman is almost completely wasted <>
its not so much that his character spends the first twenty minutes with his face frozen into a rictus but that no one seems to know what to do with him once henry does come to life <>
he still snaps off his dialogue with a seenitall rasp and he lets those famous blue eyes dart and speak when no other part of his body is capable <>
where the money is builds a charge of potential energy from his mere presence <>
it rarely however finds an effective way to release that energy <>
here he talks his way out of an encounter with a pair of cops there he pulls a fast one on a slimy orderly <>
for the rest of the film he just waits for a reason to be there <>
its hard to figure what he saw in the script since where the money is theoretically is more about carol than it is about henry <>
newman has earned better in his year career than being left to support an ineffectual caper just because thats where the money is <>

{-1} ive never read the bret easton ellis novel on which american psycho is based so i dont know whether its reputation as literary garbage is warranted <>
word on the street has it that ellis notion of satire generally involved shopping lists of designer brand names ad infinitum ad nauseam the word further informed that his descriptions of destroying a human body left little to the imagination <>
that could easily make for a very tedious dehumanizing read so i can understand why potential viewers might be skeptical about a film version of this muchreviled book <>
after all what could possibly be entertaining about watching a sociopath spend an hour and a half obsessing over colognes and suits between capital crimes <>
{1} maybe ellis didnt get it when it came to offering an icycold attack on the gogo ethos <>
mary harron however does <>
harrons telling of the tale mixes s nostalgia with pitchblack humor anchored by christian bales riveting performance <>
bale stars as patrick bateman a new york mergers and acquisitions vicepresident who lives for all the best things in life reservations at the finest restaurants a taxing physical regimen clothing by only the most deified designers <>
he also finds himself unable to control his impulse to murder on a regular basis whether the victim may be a homeless man a prostitute or an envied coworker <>
when det donald kimball willem dafoe begins poking around patrick begins to fear that he could be caught <>
then again he could have a greater fearthat he wont be caught <>
{2} the heartless soulless heart and soul of american psycho is bales brilliant performance as bateman <>
the role was once said to be leonardo dicaprios for the taking but he opted instead for the beach <>
bad for leo good for us <>
bale plays bateman with an exaggeration thats sure to be misconstrued as hamming it up <>
bateman isnt just playacting at belonging in the professional social circle in which he runs his nepotisticallyinfluenced job seems to consist mostly of reading pornography watching jeopardy and doing crossword puzzles hes playacting at being a human being <>
bales work is also brutally funny most notably in scenes where he engages in rambling deconstructions of some of the decades most banal music huey lewis hip to be square genesis in too deep <>
if this performance doesnt prove to be one of the years best were in for a very good year indeed <>
{0} there is of course also the matter of the muchtalkedabout sex and violence which cost the version screened at the sundance film festival a few seconds of excised gyrating <>
naturally the content will make american psycho a film for very specific tastes but viewers should be clear that this isnt primarily a thriller were talking about <>
yes there are suspense elements and there are a few grisly deaths most taking place out of the frame and there are some moments of moderately explicit naughtiness <>
all of those elements should also be viewed in context <>
how anyone could view batemans narcissistic orgy as pornographic or even eroitic is beyond me how the film could be perceived as a commercial for unbridled appetites and surrender to the id is baffling <>
{1} theres no point pretending american psycho has anything radically new profound or insightful to say about its era <>
satirical critiques of yuppie materialism have already become somewhat trite a decade later and its clear from minute one that the film is about turning the figurative ability to get away with murder into the literal equivalent <>
that doesnt make many of american psychos finer moments any less effective from the shallow oneliners im not really hungry but i want to have a reservation somewhere to the hysterical scene in which characters define their pecking order by the quality of their business cards <>
the third act does begin to drag and the hallucinatory closing scenes are bound to leave some viewers scratching their heads <>
but american psycho gets creepier funnier and more insinuating the longer i think about it <>
source material be damned even if ellis american psycho is junk it provided the framework for something savagely entertaining <>

[23652/4]
{-2} on the off chance that the rest of the film hadnt already irritated you or bored you to distraction and trust me it will do one or the other keith gordons waking the dead offers a special treat during its climactic scene <>
its the scene to which the whole film has been building a scene in which our hero fielding pierce billy crudup encounters his longlost love sarah williams jennifer connelly maybe <>
nine years earlier in the tense but passionate relationship between social activist sarah and wouldbe politician fielding ended when a car bomb killed sarah and two chilean dissidents <>
now with his dreams of reaching congress nearly come to fruition fielding is seeing sarah everywhere and has become convinced that she is still alive <>
thus is the stage set for a confrontation between them that takes place in a congressional office building <>
{-1} the wrongness of that setting may not strike you immediately until you consider the context <>
waking the deads brooding character study attaches itself to one crucial question is sarah really alive having stepped out of the way of fieldings ambition the only way she knew how or is fielding hallucinating her as the manifestation of his fear that political aspirations are costing him his soul <>
the effectiveness of their final encounter hinges on uncertainty over the answer to that question <>
so rather than have them meet in a bedroom or a park or a church or virtually anyfreakingwhere else they meet in a congressional office building <>
where sarah her life theoretically in danger if anyone finds out shes really alive if in fact shes really alive just wanders into a congressmans office without any identification in the middle of the night <>
any guesses as to whether a real living person would have pulled off that tidy little stunt <>
{-2} its a truly logicnumbing moment but its indicative of why waking the dead is such a catatonic failure <>
a tale of obsessive lovecum insanity based on a novel by scott spencer who also penned endless love and seems inordinately fascinated by obsessive lovecuminsanity waking the dead revels in its atmosphere of allencompassing mourning <>
gordon lays on the brooding score the lingering closeups and the ominous fadestowhite apparently intent on creating a phil spectorlike wall of despair <>
as a tone piece its beyond reproach if you dont clue in to how waking the dead is supposed to make you feel youve probably fallen asleep <>
{-1} not that anyone could blame you <>
waking the dead may do a splendid job of manufacturing gloom <>
but its incapable of giving you any reason to care about its characters <>
crudup and connelly are steady competent actors but theres nothing they can do to make the relationship between fielding and sarah as transcendently lifechanging as we must believe it was <>
gordon has no idea how to give their ideological sparring any of the passion present when two people who love each other begin to realize they just cant coexist <>
in fact gordon shows almost no understanding for how to play his most critical emotional moments <>
when fielding breaks down and confesses his delusions to his political inner circle gordon cuts away before theres a chance to see anyone reacting when fielding breaks down in front of his family gordon lingers on the tortured monologue so long theres nothing left to do but marvel at crudups inhuman cheekbones <>
{-1} gordons litany of miscalculations adds up to a film that clearly wasnt constructed to build characters <>
every supporting character is an afterthought wasting janet mcteer as fieldings sister should warrant some sort of fine but that doesnt explain why even the main characters are afterthoughts <>
in an ironic late piece of dialogue sarah warns fielding to view her as a complete person not an image not an idea <>
images and ideas are all gordon and company have in waking the dead theres not a complete person to be found in this scattershot narrative <>
there is plenty of atmospheric intensity though plenty of bodies wracked with sobs and plenty of evocative lighting andor iconography <>
and theres a final confrontation that effectively evokes surreality <>
its effective because theres nothing to ground it or anything else in waking the dead in the reality of human experience <>
certainly not the reality of wandering into a congressional office without any identification in the middle of the night <>

[23582/4]
{-1} after enduring final destination i have a renewed appreciation for david duchovny <>
ive always found his work on the xfiles to be plenty entertaining but i never realized how integral his performance as fox spooky mulder was to the success of the show <>
duchovny has one of the most thankless jobs on television he spends a fair portion of every single episode spitting out ridiculous speculative exposition <>
mulders leaps of logic make him the bob beamon of investigative analysis it is only because duchovny plays his dialogue with a strange combination of confidence and deadpan resignation that you dont want to throw something at the screen every time mulder zigs from the point a of victim with cut throat to the point z of werewolf on the prowl <>
{0} glen morgan and james wong have been part of the xfiles creative team since day one and have been key players in some of the series best episodes including musings of a cigarette smoking man <>
theyve teamed up for another wild supernatural premise in final destination but instead of david duchovny they have devon sawa <>
sawa plays alex browning a high school senior looking forward to a class trip to paris <>
while sitting in the plane waiting to take off however he has a powerful premonition of a midair disaster <>
alex and several classmates are forced to leave the plane in the ensuing panicinduced disruption and consequently become the only survivors when the disaster does come to pass <>
they all face a mixture of relief and survivor guilt but alex has an even stranger reaction <>
after one of the survivors meets a strange demise he becomes convinced that they were all meant to die on that plane and that death itself may be stalking those who cheated it <>
{-1} exactly how alex becomes convinced is a huge part of the problem <>
essentially alex accepts the rantings of a creepy mortician erstwhile candyman tony todd after he and fellow survivorpseudo romantic interest clear ali larter break into a funeral home <>
the mortician expounds at length on how death might take exception to having its victims slip through its fingers and alex instantly begins formulating a survival strategy based on these wild speculations <>
characters like the mortician are commonplace in supernatural horror films the protagonist has to have some expert from whom to learn the rules of the strange game he finds himself playing but this particular character is a ridiculous contrivance <>
alex finds an expert on deaths psyche just when he needs one never questioning for a second the credentials of an undertaker for knowing the behaviors that get death miffed <>
{-1} it doesnt help that sawa doesnt exactly act the heck out of the part <>
an earlier incarnation of the story by jeffrey reddick featured adults as the survivors before new line wong and morgan turned it into an adolescentcentered shocker <>
the performers are generally functional at best chad e donella himself an xfiles veteran as this seasons tormented brainsucker is a notable exception <>
but its the tragic combination of sawa and the script that sinks the film <>
the rules alex intuits for deaths modus operandi taking the survivors in the order they were meant to die in the plane crash skipping victims when someone intervenes etc are convoluted at best <>
with sawa dispensing those rules to the audience theyre laughable <>
a more seasoned actor might have made something of alexs evermoreobsessive interest in figuring out the workings of fate <>
sawa fumbles and flounders lacking the least shred of what duchovny brings to similarly exaggerated material <>
{-1} critics and viewers have learned not to expect much from horror films heavy on teen cast members even those with potentially promising pedigrees eg the work of another xfiles alum david nutters disturbing behavior <>
still you want to believe that talented people can take a unique premise and give it a jolt of creativity <>
wong brings plenty of visual style to the table and longtime writing partners wong and morgan have fun nodding to their thriller forebears characters named after hitchcock browning val lewton and even their xfiles boss chris carter and selecting john denvers rocky mountain high as the harbinger of the grim reaper <>
theyre just missing one crucial piece a lead actor who knows how to play the patently absurd with a wink and a shiver <>
final destination is left to play around with rube goldberg deathtraps fatally bereft of anyone who can take the silly and make it spooky <>

[23261/4]
{0} i did not outguess the first released film from an ehren kruger script arlington road <>
nor did i outguess the second released film from an ehren kruger script scream <>
kruger has shown himself to be particularly fascinated with labyrinthine plot developments the kind of stuff thats supposed to leave an audience thinking ooooooh i didnt see that coming <>
in arlington road however you could have seen it coming <>
the twist was the story brilliantly recasting the entire film as a retrospective experience <>
scream twisted because it had to and you got the sense that any one of a dozen possible endings would have seemed just as plausible <>
reindeer games would be round three perhaps proving which of krugers first two scripts was the exception and which was the rule <>
{0} once again i did not outguess kruger <>
and as with scream it didnt really matter <>
reindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy duncan a convicted car thief nearing the end of his sentence in a michigan prison <>
when his cellmate nick james frain is stabbed during a riot the day before their scheduled release rudy sees an opportunity to hook up with the gorgeous pen pal named ashley charlize theron with whom nick has been corresponding <>
posing as the pen pal ashley has never seen rudy gets a wild night with ashley <>
then things get much wilder when ashleys psychotic brother gabriel gary sinise shows up <>
he believes nick has insider information about a reservation casino where he used to work and which gabriel and his colleagues plan to hold up <>
a reluctant rudy therefore finds himself forced to mastermind a heist in a place he has never been <>
{-1} admittedly its sort of a nifty premise <>
the road to much cinematic garbage has also been littered with nifty premises <>
reindeer games may not be garbage but theres also nothing that builds a sense of identification with the films ostensible hero <>
affleck is a pleasant enough performer and hes certainly built like an action star <>
but theres something he lacks as a screen actor <>
despite the fact that most of his roles to date have required him to lose his temper there never seems to be an edge to afflecks performances <>
theres nothing behind his words when he yells hes yelling lines of dialogue <>
any attempts the film makes to dig into who rudy is or why he does what he does feel pointless <>
as the films central character affleck is just occupying space <>
{1} of course genre films like reindeer games often dont ask more of its characters <>
this one hits a few high notes along the way when kruger just decides to tell an actionfilled story <>
hes got a great director for that kind of work in john frankenheimer who knows how to make the most of dialoguefree mayhem <>
hes got a topnotch villain in gary sinise though you could argue that his characterization doesnt make much sense once all the pieces of the plot fall into place <>
and hes got charlize theron whos as easy on the eyes as anyone working in film and if im any judge destined to be considered like michelle pfeiffer as an extremely talented actress once people can get past how breathtakingly gorgeous she is <>
the casino heist itself is appropriately frantic and plenty of krugers small script moments along the way are slick enough to keep a viewer interested <>
{-1} then come the doublecrosses triplecrosses and quadruplecrosses so fast and so frequent that another one is upon you before you can remember the prefix for the next uple youre up to <>
theres no question that the events in the final halfhour of reindeer games prove surprising in the sense that the average viewer probably wont expect them <>
its also true that they dont matter in the slightest except as a sort of false cleverness <>
not only are they arbitrary i dare anyone to watch the film a second time and spot a single clue that points in the right direction but theyre insulting in a film that then goes on to make the denouement an act of supreme stupidity hint try not to leave a trail to your whereabouts if youre leaving the scene of a crime <>
for a simple genre story reindeer games ties itself up in far too many unnecessary knots <>
kruger has shown himself to be smarter than your average screenwriter <>
he has also shown that he can be too interested in proving it <>

[22918/4]
{-1} sometimes a play makes for a good film sometimes it doesnt <>
its tough to put a finger on what can make a stagetoscreen translation fall flat but i know it when i see it <>
sometimes it feels as though a filmmaker doesnt know how to make a set piece feel like a film other times the director seems to be doing little more than turning the film over to the actors reciting their lines <>
a play turned into a film can become amadeus its true it can also become oleanna <>
{-1} simpatico doesnt fail because director matthew warchus cant give sam shepards play a distinctly cinematic life he does or that he lets the actors run roughshod over the production he does that too but its not the fatal flaw <>
in this case the play itself is the thing <>
jeff bridges stars as a successful horse breeder named lyle carter who is preparing for his latest sale a triple crownwinning stallion named simpatico <>
unfortunately carter has a dark past thats about to come back to haunt him in the form of old pal vinnie webb nick nolte <>
vinnie claims to be in legal trouble in california trouble that could also make things uncomfortable for carter <>
as the lives of the two men intertwine again we learn in flashback of a scheme that gained the young carter liam waite vinnie shawn hatosy and vinnies girlfriend rosie kimberly williams a huge bankroll <>
it was also a scheme with plenty of repercussions into the present including changing the life of a onetime racing commissioner named simms albert finney <>
{1} structurally simpatico is about as sound a script as they come <>
revelations about the characters pasts appear eversogradually each one adding a shade of significance to events that have gone before <>
as a tale of guilt and coming to terms with ones mistakes its intriguing enough consistently enough that youll want to keep paying attention <>
it even offers some genuinely cinematic pleasures from john tolls eclectic cinematography to stewart copelands jangly soundtrack <>
far from the tootypical s script of plot development simpaticos story clicks along with unique rhythms <>
{-1} those rhythms just happen to be the rhythms of a play <>
no matter what is happening on screen in simpatico it never for a moment feels like the story belongs on film <>
the characters speak to each other in the clipped tones of a dialoguedependent medium full of loaded pauses and oblique references that should come with big glowing asterisks noting pay attention this will be important later <>
subplots and character developments are so fraught with significance carter and vinnie slipping casually into one anothers lives a horse thats not what he appears to be you can see the author nodding to himself at the cleverness of it all <>
even the actors generally look like theyre playing to the rafters with nick nolte all agrowl as the seedy vinnie and albert finney telegraphing his characters unambiguous ambiguity only catherine keener as a vaguely simpleminded woman unwitting involved in the story shows a welcome subtlety <>
by the time sharon stone blows into the film from some community theater tennessee williams production to play carters wife it seems almost impossible that all this is transpiring on a movie screen instead of live and in person <>
{-1} it should go without saying that striving for thematic depth and complexity is not exclusive to the live theater nor is a labyrinthine plot unworkable on screen <>
theres simply a quality to simpatico that makes it feel grossly artificial as a film experience <>
its easy to watch the film and understand what would make this story a slick atmospheric character study as a play <>
as a film however its inert moving along so deliberately you may begin to feel that youre watching a staged reading committed to film <>
i dont know if someone could take shepards play and make it a workable film but i know this one isnt it <>
simpatico may make you want to go out and see it as a stage production unless by the conclusion you feel that you already have <>

[22729/4]
{-1} late in holy smoke jane campions latest attempt at gender provocateurship the principal male character refers to the principal female character as a manhater <>
the principal female character then responds that he calls her a manhater just because i criticize you <>
i would never be so crude as to suggest that campion is a manhater but its hard to not to wonder what testosteronesoaked demons haunt her <>
its one thing to ask pointed questions about genderbased power dynamics its quite another to ask those questions using such weighty symbolism that its hard not to laugh out loud at the raving significancemongering of it all <>
{-2} campions painfully strident stylings get a workout in holy smoke a film that gets sillier and less insightful the longer i think about it <>
kate winslet stars as ruth a young woman from sydney who begins following a charismatic guru while travelling in india with a friend <>
concerned that ruth has been taken in by a cult ruths family hires one of the worlds most successful exit counselors p j walters harvey keitel to bring her around again <>
after luring ruth back to australia under false pretenses the family leaves her in an isolated cabin with walters for three days where he expects to break her down and build her up again <>
but things dont work out quite so simply leaving both parties searching for their roles in their strange relationship <>
{1} for a little while it almost seems that campion is on to something <>
the opening montage in which campion sets up ruths introduction to babas teachings is an energetic sequence set to neil diamonds holly holy <>
better still are the scenes of ruths mother julie hamilton visiting ruth in india her anxieties betraying the fact that she may be most concerned about her daughter falling in with darkskinned people <>
by mixing in the racist element with the sexist elements of her story campion promises a film that could have been a fairly complex examination of exerting power and manifesting fear of otherness <>
{-2} dont expect anything quite so measured <>
from that provocative beginning holy smoke quickly disintegrates into a sluggish ribkicking polemic <>
walters is introduced with little room for misinterpretation as a preening and selfimportant sort who slicks back his dyed hair receives oral gratification from ruths ditzy sisterinlaw sophie lee and prepares for his meetings with ruth with breath spray <>
ruth meanwhile is a free spirit whose earth mother dance to you oughtta know provides all the urfemme credentials you could want <>
campion seems little concerned with exploring the side of ruth that quickly transfers her devotion from baba to walters <>
shes far more fascinated with the sociological implications of a woman trying to escape into the wilderness by strapping books to her feet or of ruth and walters playing a rolereversal game in which walters is dressed up in lipstick and a skimpy red dress <>
for those of you who think one of cinemas most unnecessary images was keitels free willy in campions the piano please consider keitel in lipstick and a skimpy red dress <>
{-2} i suppose some viewers could find themselves intrigued enough by the shifting nature of ruth and walters relationship to give its freakish elements a pass <>
i found it far too hard to take holy smoke seriously as anything other than an opportunity for campion to rattle our collective cage whether the image is a nude ruth urinating in front of walters or walters hallucinating ruth as a manyarmed indian goddess <>
its not so much shallow as it is garish and overwrought an important message movie without a solid base of characterization to ground it <>
it has begun to appear that campion is more concerned with filming themes than with filming stories struggling against oppression without making that oppression recognizable in human terms <>
theres no need to use terms like manhating for that kind of filmmaking clumsy just about says it all <>

[22233/8]
{2} in the first moments of man on the moons splendidly inventive prologue jim carrey says hello i am andy <>
and for two hours he is <>
there is no way to describe carreys performance as andy kaufman in milos formans biopic except to say that carrey inhabits kaufman <>
when he plays kaufmans squeakyvoiced immigrant character which will become taxis latka hes pitch perfect when he dives into one of kaufmans deliberately provocative stage routines he captures a mind of lunatic inventiveness at work <>
carreys work may be the best most effective extended impression in film history <>
{1} the astonishing thing about man on the moon is how entertaining it is despite the fact that theres very little to it but carreys extended impression <>
after a brief glimpse of kaufmans childhood in long island man on the moon dives into his early days as a standup comedy performer who befuddles and aggravates his audiences as often as he makes them laugh <>
he is undeniably unique however a fact that grabs the attention of superagent george shapiro danny devito <>
shapiro sees stardom in kaufman stardom kaufman himself claims he wants <>
theres just the small matter of kaufmans insistence on pushing himself his act and his audience farther than theyve ever gone before <>
even as taxi makes him famous his stunts including an openended challenge to beat any woman in wrestling make him harder and harder for many people to take <>
{1} hard to take perhaps but impossible to ignore <>
its also impossible to deny that man on the moon owes most of its entertainment value to kaufman himself since the films biggest laughts come from recreations of kaufmans outrageous performances <>
we see his fauxnervous saturday night live lipsynch to the mighty mouse theme we see his running feud with wrestler jerry lawler playing himself that presages the popularity of professional wrestling as scripted antagonism and we see plenty of kaufmans doppleganger abrasive vegas lounge singer tony clifton <>
when a college audience demands latka kaufman responds with a reading in its entirety of the great gatsby <>
watching carreyaskaufman reach for the edges without anything resembling a net is exhilarating <>
kaufmans routines still have the ability to inspire gasping laughter <>
{0} the only question remaining and the one for which man on the moon has no answer is who andy kaufman really was and what he really was trying to accomplish in his career <>
the script by scott alexander and larry karaszewski casts a similar rosy glow over its subject as their scripts for ed wood and the people vs larry flynt making the film more of an homage to driven eccentricity than piercing character study <>
it may be true as kaufmans girlfriend lynne courtney love says to him in one scene that there is no real you but that doesnt make the absence of insight any less disapppointing <>
while man on the moons performance set pieces are dazzling in a sense they never end <>
its a portrait of an entire life lived as performance art when you keep hoping for at least a glimpse behind the curtain <>
{2} there are moments during the films final half hour when kaufman is coping with cancer and with the boywhocriedwolf repercussions as his friends and family doubt that he is really sick that we begin to see a selfaware andy <>
in one of the films best moments a trip to a philippine psychic surgery clinic becomes an ironic revelation that attempts to delude others can go too far <>
with just a few more moments like that man on the moon might have been a classic film biography <>
maybe ultimately its just a showpiece for kaufmans decadesaheadofhistime genius and for carreys dynamic rendering of that genius <>
maybe its just a grand illusion without an easilyunderstood human being behind it <>
and maybe in a story about the life of andy kaufman thats perfectly appropriate <>

{0} at one pivotal point in magnolia one of several pivotal points in paul thomas andersons epic of human connection and disconnection a woman sits alone in her apartment singing along to a song <>
at first it seems shes singing along to her stereo until anderson cuts to another character singing the same song <>
he does this half a dozen more times capturing every one of his principal characters accompanying the haunting original aimee mann composition wise up <>
as the characters struggle with moments of painful realization they become individual voices in a mournful chorus looking for forgiveness reconciliation and redemption <>
{2} that sequence in magnolia is one of the years best pieces of filmmaking and i could name a dozen more moments from the film that will be sticking in my memory <>
if anderson had pulled all those pieces of filmmaking together into a stronger whole magnolia might have been the years best film instead of just a very good one <>
its certainly an ambitious work following many characters through one rainy day in the san fernando valley <>
earl partridge jason robards is dying of cancer inspiring his young wife linda julianne moore to guiltridden thoughts and inspiring earls caretaker phil philip seymour hoffman to seek out earls estranged son selfhelp guru frank t j mackey tom cruise <>
game show host jimmy gator philip baker hall is also dying of cancer and also has an estranged child a cokeaddicted daughter named claudia melora walters who becomes the object of affection for goodnatured cop jim kurring john c reilly <>
meanwhile quiz show whiz kid stanley jeremy blackman tries to get through another show while hasbeen whiz kid donnie smith william h macy tries to get through another day <>
{2} anderson sets out to connect his stories thematically with a wild prologue involving three unrelated tales of coincidence and chance <>
in a way the whole thing is little more than an extended attempt to justify the films most surreal device more on which later <>
its also undeniably compelling charged by andersons kitchen sink visual style <>
and for three hours thats what magnolia does it delivers thrilling scene after thrilling scene which by all rights should simply feel selfindulgent <>
tom cruise is positively electrifying as the motivational speaker who teaches a course in male sexual conquest called search and destroy its the best performance of his career until he once again makes the mistake of crying on screen <>
reilly is wonderful both in his awkward flirtations with the hoppedup claudia and in his trite straightarrow response to a young wouldbe rapper <>
and macy once again finds the wounded humanity in a pathetic figure <>
{1} when anderson nails these characters at their most vulnerable and conflicted he creates sensational scenes for actors <>
magnolia plays like a cross between a symphony and a jazz jam with solo showcases building toward splendidly edited crescendos <>
the only thing missing is an anchor something that ties andersons multiple story lines together in a way that makes them greater than the sum of their parts <>
it shouldnt have been that difficult considering the parallels anderson sets up present day whiz kid and past whiz kid the two cancer patients and their angry progeny <>
and yes sins of the fathers play a role in most of the characters lives <>
its obvious anderson wants us to feel a connection <>
i just dont think he pulls it off giving more attention to the individual trespasses and recriminations than to the links between them <>
{1} theres sure to be much talk about andersons most audacious attempt to pull his story together a cloudburst in which something besides rain falls from the sky in a torrent <>
im not about to guess what anderson was thinking by loosing a biblical plague upon the san fernando valley nor will i pretend the credulitystretching trick doesnt feel more like a grand gag than a dramatic fulcrum <>
theres also something about it that just plain works maybe just as damnthetorpedoes filmmaking maybe as acknowledgement of how primal forces can throttle you into reevaluating your life <>
that in a nutshell is the wonderful frustration of magnolia <>
part of you wants to expose anderson as a philosophical poseur <>
and the other half cant stop watching everything he throws at the screen <>

yet nineteen hundred continues to struggle with the idea of leaving the ship even when he becomes infatuated with a beautiful passenger melanie thierry <>
{1} for a while the gilded romanticism of the legend of makes it easy on the eyes and ears <>
cinematographer lajos koltai burnishes every frame with a mysterious light filling the film with a sense of epic nostalgia <>
the music is frequently captivating as well with ennio morricones haunting themes building interest in the eccentric nineteen hundred <>
music also anchors the films best sequence in which jazz legend jelly roll morton clarence williams iii comes to the virginian to challenge nineteen hundred to a piano duel <>
its all quite fanciful given an undercurrent of consequence by pruitt taylor vinces performance of thousandyard stares flashing back to the friendship that changed maxs life <>
{-1} in retrospect vince deserves immense praise for his work since he manages to convey the idea that this story has something profound to say <>
its actually quite a preposterous piece of work as it turns out and not because of its protagonists unique life <>
tornatore just doesnt give us any sense of who nineteen hundred is or what hes all about <>
at times hes a dreamer who spins elaborate descriptions of places hes never been at times hes a hardnosed competitor who delights in showing up the famous jelly roll and shouting an epithet after him as he leaves the ship <>
he isnt so much a character as he is a deliberate enigma not becuase hes complex but because tornatore wants to make him an allpurpose archetype <>
tim roth gamely tries to give nineteen hundred a human face but in this fable hes not really playing a human <>
hes just a metaphor for something or other <>
{-2} if forced to guess what hes a metaphor for id have to say it ties in with early themes in the film about immigrants coming to america <>
nineteen hundreds fears of leaving the virginian may represent those who stayed behind while others dared to leave for the new world the idea of finding his fortune out there isnt as compelling as staying where things are known and comfortable <>
the legend of might have worked as a sympathetic affectionate acknowledgement of those whose fears held them back <>
unfortunately tornatore elevates a phobia to sage philosophy having max nod knowingly as nineteen hundred gives a lengthy speech about the dangers of an infinite world <>
theres something vaguely pathetic about his paean to boundaries its even more pathetic if were expected to find him somehow noble in his obsessive fear <>
the theme also appears far too late in the story leaving you to wonder about all the preceding filler that simply confuses the question of what this character is all about <>
eventually the film implodes under the weight of the importance placed on nineteen hundreds life <>
it turns out weve been suckered into caring about the fate of a vague symbol and maybe a vague symbol for something foolish and sad <>

{-1} somehow somewhere this whole anime wave has left me behind <>
sure the japanese animation style is distinctive but it strikes me that the form has not progressed radically in the years since speed racer <>
though the backgrounds may have become richer theres still a vaguely anglicized blandness to the character design a strange lack of fluidity to the acrobatic movements <>
when the japanese smash princess mononoke made its way to our shores it was spoken of as the future of animation <>
i was skeptical that it would bring anything that wasnt already the past of anime <>
{1} from an animation standpoint i still think thats true though princess mononoke does have some striking imagery <>
the real revelation in the film is the depth and complexity of its mythology and storytelling which manage to overcome the problems with the human story <>
hayao miyazakis tale begins with a prince named ashitaka billy crudup of an exiled tribe <>
in the course of defending his village from a boardemon ashitaka is infected with a malignancy that can only be cured by the great forest spirit <>
thus ashitaka begins a quest that leads him to an iron mining town at the edge of a huge forest a town led by the lady eboshi minnie driver <>
the town is in conflict not only with a rival warlord who wants a share of the iron but with the nature spirits who loathe the encroachment of humans on their forest <>
ashitaka finds himself caught in the middle especially when he becomes enamored of san claire danes the human stepdaughter of the great wolf goddess moro gillian anderson <>
{1} in case there is any confusion on the subject lets be clear that princess mononoke is a film for adults <>
heads and limbs fly at a rate approaching that of sleepy hollow and the manipulative monk jigo billy bob thornton uses some salty language <>
it also maintains an adult tone in the setup of its mystical world with gods who can be petulant violent and even just plain stupid a cosmology far more in keeping with most ancient civilizations mythologies than disneys benign pantheisms <>
most impressive miyazaki keeps his story free of the didacticism so common in films with environmental themes <>
lady eboshi isnt portrayed as some cackling grasping villain representing civilization bad instead shes a philanthropist revered by the lepers and former prostitutes she employs in her iron works <>
while the nature gods are understandably bitter as they watch forests fall theirs is not the only side of this story <>
rare is the tale that suggests industry could be a coexisting entity in nature rather than an inherent evil <>
{-1} princess mononoke is so engrossing as both legend and lesson that you wish it could treat its characters with more care <>
the conflicts of its principal characters ashitakas struggle with his evermorehomicidal infected arm sans struggle to reconcile her human and lupine backgrounds are given only passing attention leaving most of the focus on the set pieces and the philosophy <>
the line readings by the english actors are flat and constricted performances set to a stopwatch of mouth movements instead of to the needs of the scene <>
and then theres the dialogue which generally ranges from the annoyingly literalist characters seem incapable of looking at a thing without calling out its name to the purely giggleinducing i dont believe ill ever embrace unreservedly a film that includes the line forest spirit we give you back your head <>
rincess mononoke at times appears to be an animated variation on this years more ballyhooed version of mythopoetics over substance the phantom menace <>
{1} still there is something compelling about the look of princess mononoke more so than i was expecting <>
the design of the supernatural characters is always intriguing from the writhing wormbodies of the demons to the pillsbury doughboycumtikiidol sprites called the kodamas the battlefields are arresting in their gorespattered silence <>
indeed silence plays an unexpectedly effective role in this epic film giving it a sense of reverence <>
theres just the problem of those darned people whose homogeneity in word and countenance hinders an otherwise stellar effort <>
anime may be more or less what it used to be but at least the storytelling behind it is growing up <>

{-1} for about ten seconds there is the faint hope that end of days is clued in to its own absurdity <>
our hero jericho cane arnold schwarzenegger finds himself in the basement of a new york city catholic church protecting a woman named christine york robin tunney and learning a lesson in the apocalypse from a priest rod steiger <>
it seems that the evil one has taken human form gabriel byrne and plans to bring about the end of days by impregnating christine with his child <>
in order for the antichrist incarnation to take according to the priest said consummation must occur between pm and midnight on december <>
incredulously jericho asks the priest is that eastern time <>
{-2} its a nice line and it couldnt come at a more crucial time <>
for over an hour end of days fairly drowns in preposterousness <>
its the kind of film where a suspect is found carrying a matchbook that leads jericho directly to important clues and where the same suspect also has something jericho cleverly intuits is christines name carved into his stomach <>
its the kind of film where jericho locates christine by searching though new york city drivers license records apparently finding only one christine york in a city of million people <>
its the kind of film where jericho grabs a single book off a shelf and miraculously finds a clue to a mysterious pendant he has obtained <>
and its the kind of film where while being pursued by satan himself christine stops to grab her coat on the way out the door <>
after sixty minutes of painful head smacking i was ready for that glimmer of hope <>
maybe just maybe it was time to start having some fun with the end of the world as we know it <>
{-2} this however is a supernatural thriller that takes itself far too seriously <>
much of that seriousness revolves around schwarzenegger who plays an excopturnedprivate security professional wallowing in alcoholism and selfpity after the death of his wife and daughter for which he had some indirect responsibility <>
one assumes this is meant to be a chance for schwarzenegger to stretch his serious actor muscles in a plot line readymade for a little redemption christine owns a music box just like his daughter had in case the surrogate daughter angle was too obscure for you <>
but arnold plays tormented as just plain mad and the moment when he reaches divine understanding of how he can defeat the dark angel is brutally unintentionally hysterical <>
turning end of days into a character piece is a mistake letting schwarzenegger play that character is flatout foolish <>
{0} it probably seemed like a good idea at the time since theres also plenty of gunfirin helicopterdanglin subway carexplodin action <>
some of it is even pretty lively including the early chase sequence in which a suspended schwarzenegger pursues a sniper over a rooftop <>
peter hyams is a true hacktion director and he usually knows how to keep a film moving along with fireballs aplenty and several kajillion rounds of ammunition fired off <>
theres also quite a bit of unpleasant brutality in the form of snapped necks severed jugular veins and punchedout vital organs <>
its not that you expect satan to be a nice guy indeed gabriel byrne plays him effectively as a smug libertine with a very short temper but that its hard to settle in and enjoy end of days as an adventure thriller when so much is treated as grim and portentous <>
{-2} and thats really the fatal flaw of end of days it never decides on an appropriate tone <>
if were expected simply to enjoy the carnage its foolish to make the hero a lost soul <>
if were expected to take the dark scenario seriously the ridiculous plot contrivances make that impossible <>
if were expected to be genuinely scared the comic relief is a cheat though sidekick kevin pollak gets one killer line after the ubiquitous catjumpingoutofnowhere <>
end of days could have been effective either as a genre goof or as edgy sevenesque millennial creep show <>
instead its a murky dud that tries to chuckle its way out of the corner it writes itself into <>

[21567/4]
{-2} kevin smiths dogma is offensive <>
devotees of film industry scuttlebutt probably know that miramax dogmas original distributor put the film on the auction block after religious groups started turning up the heat <>
catholic organizations in particular declaimed the films subject matter many proclaiming it sacrilegious sight unseen i dont need to swim in a sewer to know it stinks went one typical slice of logic <>
it wont surprise any of those folks when i say dogma is offensive <>
and im not even talking about the theological content <>
dogma should be offensive to anyone who expects more from a movie than two hours of a filmmakers musings on every religious notion that ever came into his head <>
{-1} those musings are linked rather tenuously to a plot involving the very fate of existence itself <>
it seems two outcast angels loki matt damon and bartleby ben affleck have found a loophole involving the catholic dogma of plenary indulgence through which they plan to reenter heaven <>
circumventing gods will would however result in the end of all creation so a human agent is summoned to thwart the angels plans <>
that human is bethany sloan linda fiorentino a catholic of questionable faith and even more questions about her mission <>
accompanied by several celestial assistants including unknown th apostle rufus chris rock and the muse serendipity salma hayek and two very earthbound assistants jay jason mewes and silent bob kevin smith bethany tries to save the universe between lengthy conversations <>
{-2} and oh boy are there plenty of lengthy conversations <>
smiths eternitythreatening premise is probably meant to distract from an otherwise nonstop series of metaphysicalscripturaldoctrinal discussions on everything from the nature of god to religious intolerance it doesnt <>
dogma is an incredibly long sit a deepnprofound dorm room debate of a movie without the benefit of cold pizza and beer <>
sometimes smith is simply snarky a deconstruction of the walrus and the carpenter as a critique of organized religion in which cases he often churns out genuine laughs <>
sometimes smith is serious bartlebys rant against gods unfair preferential treatment of humans over angels in which cases hes alternately perceptive and tedious <>
and sometimes smith cops an attitude lokis swift judgment on a corporate boardroom in which cases you want to remind him that anyone who gives jay and silent bob major roles in a film should look at the plank in his own eye before going after the mote in anyone elses <>
{-2} when smith actually does get into the events of his plot things dont get much better <>
smith has always been a filmmaker only in the most nominal sense but his limitations are even more evident when he makes a halfhearted effort to add supernatural action to the mix radically shifting the tone from comedy to grim violence along the way <>
in a way the lowtech fight sequences have their charms battles always seem to occur just outside the frame and people come flying through the air from improbable directions <>
its hard to cut smith that much slack though because you cant help but think his choices are based entirely on his limited visual vocabulary <>
hell point a camera at people sitting around a table as long as youll let him <>
ask him to throw in one piece of real action for our efforts and he turns into captain coy <>
{-2} i suppose the most frustrating thing about dogma is that whatever your feelings about its messages kevin smith is the wrong messenger <>
its not that his insights arent insightful he has some interesting things to say about faith religions and selfrighteousness <>
but that hes pitching his weighty notions in such a scattershot fashion <>
life of brian could get away with borderine sacrilege because monty python played it smart and scathing dogma may be a sincere expression of belief but its too juvenile too often <>
smith opens the film with a disclaimer that the film is only meant to be a satire then includes a comment to the effect that god must have a sense of humor look at the platypus <>
you simply must do better than that if you want to turn sacred cows into fajitas <>
i hope smith feels better about religion after venting his spleen into a feature film <>
losing two hours to deep thoughts wrapped in limp jokes now that i find offensive <>

[21483/3]
{-2} i came to an epiphany while watching the bachelor an innocuousenoughonthesurface romantic comedy <>
its not the sort of film in which one would expect to achieve any moment of clarity but there it was nonetheless <>
i sat there watching this marshmallow of a movie unfold when suddenly i realized what is so ridiculously wrong with the entire romantic comedy genre circa <>
in a word its the same thing thats wrong with so many movies circa writing <>
more to the point its the refusal to acknowledge that characterizations matter when youre telling a story about a relationship <>
the bachelor is merely the latest in a long line of films where were expected to get dewyeyed over any pairing of attractive pleasant people just because theyre attractive and pleasant <>
{0} in this particular case attractive and pleasant exhibit a is jimmy shannon chris odonnell a single guy who has been watching his friends slowly but surely sucked into marriage <>
its a scary notion for jimmy even though he dearly loves attractive and pleasant exhibit b anne renee zellweger his girlfriend of three years <>
convinced despite his reservations that its time to sht or get off the pot jimmy proposes to anne very badly <>
anne refuses which leaves jimmy in a very odd position when his eccentric grandfather peter ustinov dies and leaves a very specific video will <>
jimmy stands to inhereit million if he is married by pm on his th birthday stays married for years and produces a child <>
there are only a couple of minor problems jimmys th birthday is the next day anne is nowhere to be found meaning jimmy has to find another willing bride from among his many exgirlfriends <>
{-1} its a wacky brewsters millionsesque premise acknowledged as such in one of the films better more selfaware lines of dialogue the kind where a shallow and materialistic guy learns what really matters <>
at least that would be the case if jimmy werent already a worldclass altruist <>
screenwriter steve cohen slides into the story an even more draconian condition in the will if jimmy doesnt get married not only will he lose all the money but the family billiard table buisness will be sold out from under him costing hudreds of jobs <>
from the outset jimmys motivation isnt cash its the livelihoods of his devoted employees <>
its almost embarrassing for his marital misgivings to play a role in the bachelors plot development <>
by any human standard the guy is impossibly selfless <>
{-2} and thats the essence of the gutlessness endemic to films like the bachelor the fear of giving the characters flaws to overcome on their way to happiness <>
theres never any tension between the two starcrossed lovers because theres no sense that anything remotely significant is at stake <>
the blandly nice odonnell couldnt pull off a randy cad if he tried so the filmmakers dont even let him zellwegers anne may have issues with her sickeningly affectionate parents as an impossible standard to live up to but no one dares make her anything but the woman lightly wronged <>
and forget about seeing enough of jimmy and anne together to feel invested in their potential reconciliation <>
the parade of sitcom set pieces had better be damned funny since theyre all that stands between us and a blissfully sweet foregone conclusion <>
{-2} ill admit a couple of those set pieces are amusing including ustinovs rantings about procreation and a restaurant fulltobursting with men popping questions and champagne corks <>
far more of them are either tedious or downright ghastly like the shudderinducing sight of brooke shields as an icy fortunehunter or the hideous collection of stereotypes when hundreds of potential brides gather in a church <>
youre never going to get too many raucous belly laughs from a film like the bachelor but thats not the real problem <>
nor is it the real problem that you know exactly the kind of warmnfuzzy conclusion its leading up to <>
the problem are a beginning and middle that are equally warmnfuzzy theres no spark no energy no humanity <>
its an emotional pudding guaranteed not to offend any consumers digestions <>
weve reached a point where our proxies for cinematic romantic wish fulfillment dont even have a pulse <>
the bachelor is love among the mannequins <>

{-1} i spent much of crazy in alabama trying to figure out the connection between its two largely parallel storylines <>
i spent much of the rest of the time surprised how little i cared <>
and i spent the final ten minutes marvelling how quickly a pleasant little film can turn ghastly <>
adapted by mark childress from his own novel and directed by erstwhile zorro antonio banderas crazy in alabama takes us back to in the small town of industry accent on the second syllable alabama <>
our narrator is peter joseph peejoe bullis lucas black a yearold orphan living with his grandmother <>
life is turned upside down when peejoes aunt lucille melanie griffith announces to her mother that she has killed and decapitated her abusive husband and that shes leaving her six children behind while she flees to hollywood to become a star <>
meanwhile back in industry the influx of kids sends peejoe and his brother wiley to live with uncle dove david morse the segregated towns mortician for whites <>
soon peejoe becomes aware of racial unrest stirring in the town and becomes an eyewitness to the extreme response of sheriff john doggett meat loaf aday <>
{1} i must confess that i kept forgiving crazy in alabama its excess just because it was so unexpectedly weird at times primarily in the lucilleonthelam segments <>
melanie griffith is an eccentric hoot as lucille carrying around her husbands head in a tupperware container because she wants him around to see her make it as an actress <>
her adventures are so ridiculous its hard not to smile <>
she seduces a cop and leaves him handcuffed to his own jail cell <>
she wins playing roulette in las vegas <>
she turns the hostess a splendidly uptight elizabeth perkins at a hollywood party into a catatonic mess with hubbys strategicallyplaced noggin <>
she even does a guest spot on bewitched reading her lines to toneless standins for sam darrin and company <>
the story keeps hopping in so many directions zestfully directed by banderas that its almost impossible to lose interest for long <>
{-2} it also hops back in the direction of peejoes story where strangeness generally gives way to sluggish sincerity <>
crazy in alabama plays its racial themes deadly straight turning peejoe into a preternaturally wise and moral lad who even gets to shake dr martin luther kings hand <>
in more ways than one its all black and white the buffoonishly nasty sheriff the calmly liberal father figure the noble africanamerican protesters whose plight is rendered in grainy newsreelstyle footage <>
everyone carries on in the expected ways on the expected subjects all leading to the onewouldhopeobvious conclusion that segregation was a very bad thing indeed and thank heaven for a few good white people to help set things right <>
{-2} still the zestful style of the lucille storyline makes it possible to get past the heavyhandedness of the peejoe storyline until lucille returns to industry <>
thus is set in motion one of the most painful courtroom finales in cinemas long sad history of painful courtroom finales presided over by rod steiger as the judicial equivalent of col kurtz <>
first lucille tells her tale of woe to the jury rambling on about the horrors of domestic abuse for reasons too contrived to fathom <>
youd suspect it was a matter of banderas indulging his reallife leading lady if not for the fact that steiger follows lucilles monologue with a rant of his own <>
banderas loses complete control over his actors at the films conclusion <>
worse yet the film takes two sensitive issues the subjugation of africanamericans and the subjugation of women and in attempting to equate them doesnt do justice to either one <>
its a tragic miscalculation in a film which at least had a chance when it was quirky and frivolous <>
the real craziness in crazy in alabama is that a viewer might spend so much time giving it the benefit of the doubt <>

[21287/6]
{-1} if the opening minutes of bringing out the dead start to look very familiar youre not alone even martin scorsese agrees with you <>
the story opens in the early s with ems paramedic frank pierce nicolas cage beginning the first of three consecutive chaotic shifts and at the end of his rope <>
his night shifts cruising the streets of new york city are filtered through red lights his voiceover narration scripted by paul schrader from joe connellys novel reveals a soul in turmoil <>
fueled only by alcohol and coffee haunted by the image of a girl he couldnt save frank is ready to snap <>
theres a correlation to taxi driver theres no doubt scorsese comments in the press notes which admission can only inspire a sarcastic no really <>
for a while you suspect the film should be called ambulance driver <>
{1} scorsese ultimately takes bringing out the dead somewhere quite different which is both a blessing and a disappointment <>
much of the film is spent on the daytoday or in this case nighttonight life of the paramedics and on that level its often fascinating and brutally hilarious <>
franks three riding partners provide a variety of perspectives on the way people respond to the stresses of the occupation <>
larry john goodman remains distant focused either on his next meal or the private medical response company he plans to open some day marcus ving rhames turns emergency calls into opportunities to do a little of the lords work notably in a wonderful scene where he a resuscitation in a goth nightclub becomes an impromptu tent revival meeting tom walls tom sizemore turns into a wild animal ready to beat the hell out of his truck or a frustrating patient whichever happens to be at hand <>
even the trips into the our lady of perpetual mercy emergency room a barelycontrolled bedlam that would send even the er cast screaming for the hills pound home the nightmare of the job <>
when scorsese and cinematographer robert richardson keep their eyes trained on the kinetic frenetic world of pierce and his cohorts bringing out the dead has the darkly comic vibe of mash providing entertaining if occasionally unnerving insight into a violent world where the only sane response is to go a little insane <>
{-1} there is however a backbone to this story if not an exceptionally strong one <>
bringing out the dead is ultimately a redemption tale in which frank longs to escape from the feeling that every call is hopeless and that he no longer has the power to save anyone <>
much of that story focuses on his relationship with mary patricia arquette a woman whose father frank revives after a cardiac arrest <>
frank becomes obsessed with mary rescuing her from a relapse into drug use and becoming her personal liaison on her fathers condition <>
his relationship with mary should shine a narrative light into his soul yet franks personal crisis never becomes nearly as vivid as the world in which he exists <>
cage delivers a performance that is alternately wildeyed and catatonic a frustrating pastiche of previous cage roles instead of a distinct character of its own <>
the moments when frank isnt on the job when hes trying to find some semblance of peace and normalcy should be bringing out the deads emotional anchor <>
more often they leave you wondering when someones going to get back in an ambulance so the real action can continue <>
{-1} scorsese and schrader really miss the mark in the films final minutes when franks epiphany becomes a depressingly obvious combination of glindathegoodwitch dialogue and purifying white light <>
its all well and good that scorsese and shrader claim theyve a little mellower now and that years after taxi driver theyve opted for something a bit less bleakly pessimistic <>
the model travis bickle didnt necessarily need to be an armed sociopath but his actions still needed to draw us into the way one man deals with new yorks grim underworld <>
theres plenty of visual gusto to bringing out the dead and there are plenty of wildly entertaining episodes to keep you watching <>
its just hard not to wish for a personality half as intensely memorable as bickle to pull it all together <>
whenever franks introspections take center stage you need to keep rousing yourself to ask are you talkin to me <>

[21249/2]
{-2} body shots opens with a profound quote attributed to anonymous ill give you a rideon my jelly rollbut i wont give you nothinfrom my soul <>
thats about as succinct a summation as any for this lugubrious pretentious exercise in gen y navelgazing that follows eight single young los angelenos through a clubhopping friday night and a whatthehellhappened saturday morning <>
four guy pals rick sean patrick flanery mike jerry oconnell shawn brad rowe and trent ron livingston meet up with four gal pals jane amanda peet sara tara reid whitney emily procter and emma sybil temchen at a hot nightspot and begin pairing off in various combinations <>
accompanying their dalliances are running talktothescreen commentaries by the characters on contemporary love and sex that make the confessional segments on the real world look like revelations of zen wisdom <>
{-2} those pseudoprofound asides spending long stretches on subjects like oral sex technique under the winking guise of telling it like it is are plenty bad enough to make body shots an irritating experience <>
it becomes positively headacheinducing when director michael cristofer starts dragging out each and every scene for all the slowmotion lingering pause significance its worth <>
characters spin in blissful kisses on the dance floor for minutes at a time serenaded by the droning observations of their friends interminable silences are punctuated by someone elses equally interminable silence <>
its one thing to make a movie about lifes painfully uncomfortable moments its another to make that movie panifully uncomfortable for the people watching it <>
{-2} things go from very bad to even worse in the final half hour which is dedicated almost exclusively to a hesaidshesaid date rape scenario involving testosteronebeast professional football player mike who apparently didnt get the memo that the raiders had moved back to oakland and the flirtatious sara <>
the jerky flashbacks show wildly different versions of the same event as cristofer strains to give the tale rashomonlike credibility <>
then strangely the incident becomes less about exploring lack of communication between sexual partners than about lecturing on the treacherous combination of alcohol and raging libidos you halfexpect someone to step out of character and tell you where you can find literature on helping friends avoid binge beergoggling <>
both mike and sara get to stare at the floor pensively as they try to figure out exactly what they really remember every passing second of the violent rape sara recounts feeling more exploitative because theres no reason for us to care about the people involved <>
{-2} the reason theres no particular reason for us to care is that these characters arent really people <>
the ad campaign for body shots touts it as one of those movies that define every decade but screenwriter david mckenna makes his decadedefining generalizations by making his characters singletrait generic shawn is sensitive emma is sensitive in a slightly different way whitney has a vaguely southern accent <>
only ron livingston as the crews resident eccentric gets enough unique personality to make a comic impression which he does admirably in the films few worthwhile scenes <>
the monotonous talkinghead asides provide the only insight body shots has to offer into its characters and then mckenna uses the time to blow the lid off the fact that gasp theres a sexual doublestandard between men and women <>
with its marathon sex scenes and graphically trite narration body shots generally feels like porn with delusions of social commentary <>
ultimately its just there to give you a ride on its jelly roll but it wont give you nothin from its soul <>

{1} if i had to pick a friends cast member to star in a feature film not contribute mind you but star id pick matthew perry <>
that may seem a fairly faint praise since courtney coxs contribution to two scream ensembles notwithstanding the six small screen compadres havent exactly burned up the big screen <>
each has his or her appeal but perry is more wellsuited to carrying a mainstream comedy <>
hes got charm hes got comic timing hes got most of what you need to give an audience goodnatured entertainment <>
{0} he does not however have the right stuff for a variation on tootsie especially one as ineffectual as three to tango <>
thats the essence of this romantic comedy that casts perry as chicago architect oscar novak <>
oscar and his business partner peter oliver platt are up for a huge contract a cultural center financed by tycoon charles newman dylan mcdermott <>
when charles asks oscar to keep tabs on his mistress amy neve campbell oscar quickly agrees believing his assistance may give an edge to his firm <>
he doesnt realize until its too late that charles only gave him the assignment because he believes oscar is gay <>
that complication only gets more complicated when oscar obliged to keep playing the part starts to fall for amy who also believes hes gay <>
{-1} three to tango is framed like tootsie as the story of a man who learns something about himself by pretending to be something hes not <>
there are the expected farcical elements the amused reactions of those who really know oscar the awkward and unwanted attentions of a wouldbe suitor a confusing night in bed with the woman friend delivered in a functionally chuckleinspiring manner <>
and maybe three to tango could have had a little spark if there were actually anything for oscar to learn <>
at the outset hes a chronically nervous sweetheart with relationship hard luck effective for creating a sympathetic protagonist but useless on a narrative level <>
imagine oscar as a womanizing homophobe forced to pose as a gay man and think of how much more robust a farce it could have been <>
{-1} of course such an angle is too potentially alienating for hollywood in addition to being all wrong for matthew perry <>
misconceptions about chandlers sexual orientation were a running gag on friends for years which would make perry seem perfect for the role <>
indeed he does a great frustration take and his winning smile makes it easy to root for him to get the girl <>
perry is almost warm and engaging enough to make three to tango watchable through the sheer appeal of his personality <>
but hes still entirely wrong for the part <>
actually hes right for the part as written which is pleasant and nonthreatening <>
its the part thats wrong for the movie <>
the anger and bitterness of dustin hoffmans michael dorsey gave tootsie its transgender kick <>
because niceness is always oscars defining quality three to tango never had a chance at being anything but sporadically nice <>
{-1} and its only sporadically nice since perry gets little help from his castmates <>
platt is quickly becoming cinemas most reliable second banana but he doesnt get much to work with <>
mcdermott plays a generically icy corporate shark and he has even less to work with <>
then theres neve campbell whose appeal frankly baffles me <>
as the freespirited artist and object of oscars affections shes all affected unconvincing effervescence <>
theres a superficial topicality to the films themes but its really the sort of pure froth that lives or dies on the basis of its romantic pairing <>
if youre able to smile along with oscar and amys sitcomplicated courtship more power to you <>
i could only smile along with perry whose selfdeprecating nice guy screen presence deserves a much better vehicle preferably one where it makes sense for the protagonist to be a selfdeprecating nice guy <>

{2} as the story of us nears its conclusion katie jordan michelle pfeiffer finally breaks down <>
katie a detailoriented crossword puzzle creator and her husband ben bruce willis a freespirited writer have spent the summer in a trial separation while their two kids are away at camp trying to determine whether their year marriage is worth saving <>
finally the tense meetings and whatsbestforthechildren rationalizations dissolve into tears as katie rants for several minutes about everything that has been right and wrong with their relationship and about the history they share <>
it is a wonderfully affecting moment beautifully performed by pfeiffer with all the love and frustration that makes up a marriage <>
its a moment that cant help but bring mist to the eyes of anyone who has known that love and those frustrations <>
{-2} its also a moment that is a complete cheat <>
theoretically the story of us is the story of how easy it is in the middle of all the white noise and tension of everyday life to lose track of why you fell in love with someone in the first place <>
unfortunately its such a fragmented narrative that its just as easy for the audience to lose track of why they fell in love in the first place <>
the script by alan zweibel and jessie nelson sprinkles flashbacks through the summer of the jordans separation a peek at their meeting and first date here an interrupted dalliance on the butcher block there but there arent nearly enough of them <>
the story of us spends virtually all its time showing us the relationship already in trouble making it incredibly difficult to appreciate what made the relationship good in the first place <>
were asked to invest ourselves emotionally in the success or failure of the jordans marriage without getting enough evidence that it should succeed <>
{-1} its even more frustrating to realize that the story of us is so solid at its core that it could have been wonderful <>
the film is not always a pleasant experience showing off some extremely unfair fighting between its protagonists and the wrenching moments when emotional damage seems beyond repair <>
willis and pfeiffer deftly turn their postseparation scenes into awkward shuffles between longing and despair where most films treat divorce either as allacrimony or allindifference this one captures how much people want it all to work out <>
but at only minutes the story of us feels bereft of context <>
somewhere on the cutting room floor is the arc of a relationshp from affection to simple coexistence to a blur of petty bickering <>
{-2} if only more of the socalled humor had found its way to the same floor <>
along for comic relief are some usually reliable performers director rob reiner as stan bens best friend rita wilson as rachel katies best friend and stans wife paul reiser as bens agent who wind up stuck with painfully unfunny material <>
wilson rants about how men never change the toilet paper roll a gag that hasnt gotten any fresher since it was generated by bad standup comics years ago <>
reiner waxes philosophical about how there is no ass just the fleshy tops of your legs <>
reiser spends five minutes degrading an idea for a book about bens grandparents inspiring only stony silence from the audience <>
reiner and his writers keep trying so hard to lighten the mood they only end up breaking it with little to show for their efforts but a few halfhearted chuckles <>
{-1} its easy to see the comedy as part of reiners attempt to create a companion piece to his gem when harry met sally <>
with its direct addresses to the camera and hairdochange time lapses the story of us does sometimes feel like when harry left sally <>
yet while this film was unlikely to be as purely entertaining it could have been far more resonant <>
some of the individual scenes in the story of us are heartbreaking and a few are truly charming <>
they just never quite add up to the story of them in a way that provides real catharsis <>
just before katies big emotional scene we get a second montage of hights and lows from a year marriage <>
its easy to understand why those snippets would move katie to tears after all she lived those moments <>
the story of us could have moved us all if only wed been allowed to live them too <>

oh yes and theres also a hockey game of some sort <>
{-1} after two obscenely bloated hours of mystery alaska the question may no longer be how david e kelley the practice ally mcbeal chicago hope snoops can be so prolific but why he doesnt know when to quit <>
ostensibly the film is the story of a tiny alaskan hamlet with a tradition of great skaters participating in a ritualistic saturday afternoon hockey game against one another <>
when danner writes a sports illustrated cover story on mystery the nhl decides to send the new york rangers for a goodwill exhibition game against the scrappy underdogs <>
the setup is extremely promising gradually revealing the importance of hockey and the saturday game to the residents of mystery <>
with carter burwells typically splendid score adding to the mystery of mystery theres hope that kelley and director jay roach will combine an amusing little sociology lesson about smalltown pride with the everappealing scrappy underdog story <>
{-2} they then proceed to heap so much extra baggage on the story that it never has a chance of getting off the ground <>
its one thing to spend time on biebes story in which his emasculating ouster from the saturday game runs parallel with his jealousy of local celebrity danner who also happens to be the old flame of biebes wife donna mary mccormack <>
theres even an excuse however feeble for marlas awkward attempts to make sure steve wont leave her for an easier catch <>
the rest of the halfdozen or so plot threads in mystery alaska are just plain inexcusable <>
the first hour of the film is a grinding ordeal so fragmented and unfocused that its easy to forget what its all supposed to be leading up to <>
{-2} in the final halfhour when the film finally gets around to the hockey game mystery alaska generates at least a little energy <>
the rangers are a fairly anonymous opponent too much time is wasted on tangents to create a worthy adversary but roach directs the game scenes with plenty of verve <>
then even the game begins to overstay its welcome losing momentum by the minute <>
any potential for a rousing conclusion is lost in memories of the preceding two hours with its two typically bombastic kelley courtroom scenes tedious pacing and undisciplined script <>
mystery alaska is a film that inspires slackjawed frustration leaving a viewer scrambling for a reason why this simple concept went so horribly wrong <>
the answer may be just as simple perhaps kelley grew bored with something as mundane as a single film and decided to turn it into a rambling two hour pilot for yet another television series <>

{-1} it is entirely likely that few viewers will think of happy texas as an instantly dated comedy <>
theyll laugh along with the broad humor letting the premise take them along on all its wacky misunderstandings and complications <>
theyll roar like the audience member in front of me at the incongruous situations <>
and while there are plenty of things that are worth a chuckle in happy texas <>
there is this one glaring issue that made it impossible for me to surrender completely to its zaniness <>
you see in happy texas homosexuality itself is the punch line <>
its a superbly cast featurelength episode of threes company <>
{0} the story begins on a texas chain gang where con artist harry sawyer jeremy northam car thief wayne wayne wayne jr steve zahn and murderer bob maslow m c gainey are on their way back to solitary after a scuffle <>
a close call with an armadillo sends the transport van into a ditch freeing the three prisoners with maslow freeing himself more completely while leaving harry and wayne chained together <>

the two men are steven and david profesional beauty pageant organizers hired to prepare local gradeschool girls for the little miss freshsqueezed competition <>
oh and steven and david also happen to be gay lovers <>
{-1} naturally harry and waynes roleplaying leads to confusion and awkward moments <>
some of those moments are indeed very funny particularly waynes spastic first attempts at choreography and his brusque manner with the children <>
others are ridiculously trite like the number of occasions in which harry and wayne are caught in what appears to others to be a tender moment <>
happy texas tries to create some character relationships notably a pseudoromance between harry and local bank president jo profilers ally walker but theres not much to any of the interactions that feels genuine <>
when the film builds towards a willtheyorwontthey involving harry and jo the more appropriate question given the slapdash efforts at building harrys character arc is whyshouldwecare <>
{-2} the reason nothing has any resonance or even much humanity to the belly laughs is that happy texas seems entirely content to be a sitcom <>
when the towns laconic sheriff chappy william h macy reveals his own affections for harry the scene could have been played simply for the comic awkwardness of the moment <>
instead you can feel the audience responding giddily to the mere idea of one man touching another to the sight of a gay bar to chappy and harry slow dancing <>
the wonderfully talented macy invests chappy with far more warmth and dignity than the character deserves <>
but theres something disconcerting about the whole enterprise <>
while it may seem surrealistically forwardthinking to have an entire small texas town respond with tolerant indifference to the idea of two gay men working with their children the device actually serves the opposite purpose <>
i was left watching a fishoutofwater comedy in which the land animals werent in on the jokes at the fishes expense <>
{-1} happy texas winds up even clumsier when maslow returns setting up a carchaseandshootout showdown <>
at least by that point the film has surrendered to its lowbrow sensibilities making for a raucous comedy with little subtlety <>
the talent in the cast keeps sparking happy texas to comic high notes macy as already noted is utterly charming zahn is a delightfully highstrung and bugeyed <>
yet those notes rarely blend into a happy tune <>
i cant imagine the film played that way on the page with this many gifted actors interested but happy texas offers the same situations john ritter turned into laughtrack gold years ago <>
how little has changed in the gay s <>

{0} in three kings writerdirector david o russell seems intent on creating the quintessential debunking of the official gulf war story <>
eight years ago the war was treated as a great boost to national pride in the midst of a recession a pseudoexorcism of the vietnam demons and a vision of the great bloodless technobattle that would become the way of warfare <>
it was all nightvision and smartbombs desert shields and protections of sovereignty a just war waged against a powermad dictator <>
we were swept up in the images watching our forces hammer away towards a foregone conclusion <>
{-1} theres more than a little irony to the fact that three kings is just as visually striking as the gulf war and nearly as shaky in its substance <>
the story focuses on a quartet of us army soldiers eyeing a personal windfall as the war reaches its conclusion in march <>
sgt troy barlow mark wahlberg staff sgt elgin ice cube and pvt conrad vig spike jonze discover a map they believe leads to a fortune in plundered kuwaiti loot <>
special forces capt archie gates george clooney also learns of the map but believes theres far more to be had than cell phones and rolexes specifically bunkers filled with millions in gold bullion <>
the four men begin a journey into the heart of iraq to cash in but they soon discover a nation still at war and find that their mission objectives keep shifting as they learn more <>
{1} as a moderately revisionist history lesson theres no question that three kings both engages and enlightens <>
russell paints a picture of american troops as rowdy kids celebrating victory in a war they barely fought while the brass concerns itself primarily with feeding reporters stories to keep them happy <>
meanwhile iraqi citizens initiate rebellion against saddam hussein after being promised support by america then find themselves slaughtered by iraqi troops when it becomes clear that no cavalry will be on its way <>
three kings becomes a journey of discovery for the four soldiers their quest for personal gain gradually giving way to a belief that they cant obey the orders that would have them abandon iraqi rebels to their deaths <>
{-1} provocative moral dilemmas abound in three kings which should be the stuff of compelling drama somehow it just isnt <>
the messages are similar to those familiar from antiwar films like paths of glory mash and platoon war is even more hellish when policy has little to do with humanity yet the characters are not nearly as strong <>
while clooney wahlberg and company perform capably russell doesnt give them much to work with beyond surface characterizations gates the jaded veteran vic the simpleminded hick barlow the naive family man etc <>
theyre too often placed in situations where other characters explain to them the real horrors of the war turning chunks of three kings into an informative but stagnant lecture <>
russell wants to put a personal face on an impersonal war but he can only create an urgency of situation not urgency connected to the people in the situation <>
{0} he can also create plenty of urgency with his stylistic flourishes of which plenty abound <>
three kings is a genuinely eyecatching piece of work in which russell makes bold choices to drive home a point from the graphic internal images of a wounded body to the slowmotion punctuation of bullet wounds as video game warfare tears through real flesh <>
unfortunately the same impulse to drive a point home leads to scenes in which a scene described in dialogue is simultaneously portrayed on screen <>
hearing an iraqi soldier said taghmaoui describe his infant sons death during a bomb raid is wrenching watching the infant crushed by debris is startling combining the two is pure overkill <>
{0} in retrospect im not sure why i still admired three kings as much as i did <>
its certainly an unconventional film zigzagging between dark comedy and raw drama with surprising effectiveness <>
every once in a while russell will do one of those little things that remind you how invigorating cinema can be <>
theres just not enough to shake the sense that three kings is too enamored of its sense of historical importance <>
all that remains is getting swept up in the images watching russells forces hammer away towards a foregone conclusion <>

[20635/4]
{-1} there is a scene early in jakob the liar that hints at how much better it could have been <>
the scene is set in a jewish ghetto in poland circa where a onetime cafe proprietor named jakob heym is walking resolutely through the streets fists stuffed into coat pockets <>
to one side of him residents scavenge for food in the street to the other side german troops beat a group of jews <>
jakob however never stops moving <>
its an efficient effective setup for the character who is clearly nobodys idea of a hero at the outset <>
he is a man who has responded to the horror of his surroundings by withdrawing from them excising his moral peripheral vision <>
{0} the setup is critical because fate will turn jakob into a reluctant savior <>
after a visit to a german commandants office and a moment alone with a turnedon radio jakob learns that russian troops are quite near <>
when he brings this first news of the war in years to his fellow jews they become convinced that he must have a radio which is a punishable offense in the ghetto <>
the good news brings hope to the ghetto the everyday specter of suicide vanishes <>
a private man of limited creativity finds himself burdened with creating stories of russian military progress just to keep his neighbors alive <>
{-1} this promising story of an ordinary person doing the extraordinary is burdened from the outset by casting the ordinary person in question jakob heym is played by robin williams <>
i am of the depressing opinion that williams is growing less assured as an actor in his serious roles with every passing year <>
compare his dramatic scenes in the world according to garp and moscow on the hudson with what dreams may come or patch adams and see how much more mannered he has become or at the very least how much less sensible at choosing material <>
jakob the liar depends on the notion that jakob has to struggle to craft his fictions but williams always looks like hes struggling not to craft them <>
when he improvises a radio address by winston churchill for ailing yearold orphan lina hannah taylor gordon he seems relieved that he can finally get wacky <>
{-2} oh yes and then theres that little girl <>
some viewers will undoubtedly consider the heros fanciful stories for a young charge too reminiscent of life is beautiful but those scenes arent problematic because theyre familiar <>
theyre problematic because theyre jarring and distracting introducing a cutesy relationship into a film that shouldnt have been about cutesy relationships <>
jakobs character arc may be about his willingness to act for the benefit of others but there are plenty of others without poor little lina <>
every scene with her feels contrived pulling jakob the liar away from its central story of hope coming to a previously hopeless people <>
{-1} it is a pleasant surprise to find that jakob the liar is a much grittier production than you might expect from a hollywoodized holocaust combining the weighty subject matter with dark humor in some effective ways <>
director peter kassovitz working from jurek beckers novel crafts some nice scenes between jakob and the other townspeople and draws solid performances from armin muellerstahl as a oncerevered doctor and bob balaban as a barber drifting into depression <>
there are just too many things going on that prove distracting whether its the sketchy romanctic angle involving liev schreiber as an earnest former prizefighter or williams incongrous presence or a sweet but utterly irrelevant little girl <>
jakob the liar deals with too delicate a subject for such fumbling and has too compelling a central character to waste <>
and after one wonderful early scene you can see the film wasted and fumbled away <>

[20478/6]
{0} yes its true stir of echoes features a child who sees dead people <>
it includes in its metaphysics the notion that disgruntled spirits cause chilly temperatures in the human world <>
it is at least partially a tale of a wrongful death made right <>
depending on where you fall in the old glass halffullhalfempty argument stir of echoes is the beneficiary of either extraordinarily good timing or extraordinarily bad timing <>
maybe comparisons with megasuccess the sixth sense will doom it to obscurity <>
or maybe a spillover effect with moviegoers still hungry for supernatural subject matter will present it with an audience it might not otherwise have had <>
{0} for my money viewers cant go far wrong either way <>
if they go theyll be moderately satisfied if they dont go they wont be missing all that much <>
it begins as a tale of a working class chicago guy named tom witzky kevin bacon who dabbles in a garage band and generally feels his life hasnt amounted to all that much <>
that perception changes radically when his sisterinlaw illeana douglas hypnotizes him at a party turning him into a receiver for weird psychic visions featuring a missing neighborhood teenager jenny morrison <>
tom also discovers that his yearold son jake zachary david cope is even more tuned into the netherworld and that his wife maggie kathryn erbe is understandably freaked out by his odd behavior <>
{-1} its awfully easy to dwell on the similarities between stir of echoes and the sixth sense weighing in simply with whether the former is better or worse than the latter <>
it would be easier to ignore those similarities if the whole film didnt feel overly familiar <>
when a kindly black cop eddie bo smith jr informs maggie of jakes visionary gifts he suddenly turns into scatman crothers in the shining when toms obsessive behavior leads him to tear up the house and alienate his family hes richard dreyfuss in close encounters of the third kind <>
the richard matheson novel on which stir of echoes is based is forty years old so no one can rightly accuse the film of thievery <>
that doesnt change the way stir of echoes is likely to be viewed today a mishmash of familiar elements <>
{1} thats not to say that stir of echoes isnt also a reasonably effective thriller in its own conventional way <>
david koepp who helmed the unsettling and littleseen trigger effect has a knack for crafting a scene that gets under your skin without resorting to too many shock cuts <>
he also draws nice work from a solid cast particularly erbe adding a few shadings to the thankless wife role <>
koepps direction may get a little showy jittery timelapse shots of ghosts funky business in the theater of toms hypnotic trance but it does its job manufacturing the creeps <>
it aint deep but its scary enough <>
{-1} unfortunately for stir of echoes its less effective than it could be because koepp seems to think it is deep <>
the subtext of joe sixpack tom seeing his new gift as a shot at finally doing something extraordinary comes and goes and its hard to see anything voluntary in his character arc <>
bacons performance suffers from this erratic motivation hes reasonably convincing both in his terror and in his determination but the two never come together <>
by the time koepp trots out an extended flashback of a crime in progress his melodrama has bogged down the chills <>
ironically thats yet another way stir of echoes is like the sixth sense its a moderately clever genre diversion that wants us to believe its something more <>

[20302/3]
{0} for nearly minutes chill factor actually warrants comparison to the film it tries so hard to bring to mind <>
the sequence occurs on a switchback section of highway where our protagonists mason skeet ulrich and arlo cuba gooding jr are trying to escape our villains a military unit headed by renegade army man maj andrew brynner peter firth <>
mason is trying to get a dangerous and volatile chemical defoliant known as elvis which must be kept below degrees to avoid a deadly explosion to a military base and has commandeered ice cream delivery driver arlos truck for the job brynner wants to auction the weapon to the highest foreign bidder <>
as the wreck of a truck rattles along the twolane highway the passengers must contend with members of brynners team jumping on board a blownout section of blacktop over a precipitous fall and closeencounters with other vehicles <>
for minutes its almost speed with a thermometer instead of a spedometer <>
{-2} during that minute chunk of the film director hugh johnson does everything an action film director needs to do offering plenty of close calls and nervous laughter <>
unfortunately those minutes occur smack in the middle of the film between minutes of excruciating introductory exposition and minutes of alternatingly absurd and tedious conclusion <>
the burst of action seems like its going to be the payoff for sitting through one of the longest least interesting prologues to an action film ever a prologue which lays out brynners feud with elviss creator david paymer in exhaustive detail <>
then almost before you get a chance to enjoy the few thrills chill factor can provide it sends mason and arlo on a leisurely paddle down the river so they can bond over their past mistakes and its all downstream from there <>
{-2} it might have been at least remotely worth sitting through all that exposition if the characters or performances hadnt made you want everyone involved to end up chemically defoliated <>
cuba gooding jr is rapidly turning into one of the most aggravating oscarwinning actors in history a onenote performer who widens his eyes and tightens his jaw to express practically every emotion the direction of the corners of his mouth is the only hint as to his mood <>
his work in chill factor borders on the embarrassing a frantic collection of overthetop reactions that would make martin lawrence and chris tucker blush <>
skeet ulrich could only hope to register an emotion of any kind using a flat delivery for even flatter lines <>
and colin firth squints and rasps his way through the villain role never quite sure whether he should be a moustachetwirling melodrama baddie or tormented soldier with shattered patriotism <>
{-2} the absence of a sympathetic hero and solid villain damage an action film but theyre not always fatal <>
it can even get away with ridiculous plot developments like the idea that a toxic chemical gas could be contained inside a traffic tunnel by blowing up both sides of the tunnel creating the evereffective pileofrubble vacuum seal <>
but there is no way an action film can get away with so little action <>
chill factor just sits there inert for nearly its entire running time even forgetting during its best moments to remind us of the status of its key plot elements rising temperature <>
its hard to believe that a film this weightless would waste so much time on setting up the premise then never exploit the premise <>
if you want to want to imagine chill factor and imagine why its not even worth the time of a trueblue action fan think of speed with minutes of the film set at a bus stop <>

[20210/3]
{-2} i note the following in the interest of fairness a smattering of audience applause greeted the conclusion of a dog of flanders at the screening i attended <>
that audience consisted almost entirely of parents and preteens causing me to ponder comments ive received over the years regarding whether family films should be held to a different critical standard <>
sure a dog of flanders could appeal to children without very discriminating tastes yes parents may be happy to find something warm n fuzzy for the younguns <>
i however watched as someone who expects little things like decent performances a narrative with a point and a script that doesnt feel like it was written by children instead of for children <>
a dog of flanders is simple nonthreatening harmless family filmmaking that also happens to be thoroughly uninteresting on almost any level <>
{0} based on a th century childrens tale by ouida a dog of flanders tells the story of a young boy named nello daas jesse james living in belgium presumably the late s presumably around antwerp <>
a poor farmboy living with his ailing grandfather jack warden nello dreams of being a great painter some day like his idol peter paul rubens <>
despite the support of kindly local artist michel la grande jon voight however nello seems trapped by his social station <>
class conflict grows more evident when the teenage nello jeremy james richter encounters objection to his friendship with a merchants daughter farren monet and even finds himself accused of arson <>
but nello always perseveres entering a youth art contest and maintaining a pure and honest heart <>
{-2} if you notice the conspicuous lack of any dog mentioned in that plot summary theres a very good reason <>
despite the title nellos pet bouvier des flanders patrasche plays only a token role in the films events <>
thats not just unfortunate because its somewhat deceptive its unfortunate because the dog may turn in the films best performance <>
the young performers particularly newcomer farren monet at least have inexperience as an excuse <>
voight and warden who fuss and knit their brows and play with evervarying accents earn no such slack <>
a dog of flanders may be a youth melodrama but theres not a moment of real characterbased emotion to make the film tolerable as a narrative <>
its hard to imagine how a production like this avoided the directtovideo dustbin <>
{-2} its also hard to imagine from this version that the story is such a classic that it has already been filmed three previous times <>
without a familiarity with either the source material or the earlier film incarnations i can only assume that a story with such appeal had to focus on the adventures of a boy and his faithful dog <>
this film focuses on the adventures of a boy as he discovers the pitfalls of his poverty takes milk into town draws pictures of his childhood sweetheart discusses art theory with his mentor la grande and learns hard lessons about the politics of youth art contests <>
there is a colorful encounter with a traveling circus its true and one moderately rousing chase and knife fight with patrasches cruel former owner <>
otherwise a dog of flanders delivers the kind of timeless youth appeal one usually associates with an evening of cnn <>
{-2} i suppose its pointless to add the cartoonish villainy of nellos landlord who also yells at his wife and calls her woman so we know hes a really bad guy or to note the retinarattling eyerolling that accompanied a yodalike apparition of rubens himself or to snicker at the wizard of oz denouement which includes a notatall startling revelation of parentage <>
those who enjoy the film will probably find ways in which those elements complement the story perfectly <>
for me a dog of flanders lacked any of the elements which bring life to a family film emotional resonance strong relationships welldrawn characters <>
im not going to deny the appeal of a protagonist who perseveres and maintains a pure and honest heart especially for parents looking to teach strength of character <>
it would have been nice however to build a watchable film around that strength of character <>
ill leave this one to those parents and children who watch with a heroic generosity of spirit those who wont leave thinking the real dog is the film itself <>

{-1} from the department of token praise give john mctiernan and michael crichton some credit for an action film in which the hero is an arab <>
after years of middle eastern fanatics as hollywoods favorite postcold war villains the th warrior features as its protagonist ahmed ibn fahdlan antonio banderas looking somber and pensive in heavy eye liner a diplomat and poet in th century baghdad <>
banished to an unpleasant nomadic ambassadorship after a dalliance with a powerful mans wife ibn fahdlan happens upon a group of norsemen who have recently lost their king <>
when another king sends word that help is needed against a hideous foe the heir apparent buliwyf vladimir kulich leads a band of thirteen warriors including the reluctant ibn fahdlan to defeat the ghoulish wendol who eat those they slay <>
{-2} all right so the arab hero is played by a spaniard hollywood needs to crawl before it can stagger in a remotely straight line <>
the problem with the th warrior isnt its multicultural sensitivity but the unlikely context in which that subtext is placed <>
at its core the film is the kind of swordsandshields romp little seen since the early s heyday of schwarzenegger as conan the barbarian and singer as the beastmaster <>
there are dimly lit battles inhuman foes tankards of ale and much bonding between brothersinarms <>
that the bonding occurs between rambunctious polytheistic nordic guys and a devout muslim gives the narrative a funky anachronistic flavor dungeons and dragons for the why cant we all just get along s <>
{-2} theres nothing automatically offputting about watching men exchanging prayers in the first millennium its not as though the th century introduced the concept of tolerance <>
it just happens to be the most obvious example of the th warriors insistence on attending to subplots and subtext when it hasnt provided the basic framework for an adventure <>
ibn fahdlans norse comrades are so interchangeable and lacking in personality that the press notes identify them both by name and by some trait that might jog the memory helfdane fat ragnar dour and so on <>
the wendol remain shadowy and indistinct never developing into truly threatening villains despite the gasps that accompany the mention of their name <>
meanwhile theres time spent on a blinkandyoullmissit romantic interlude for ibn fahdlan and a bit of norse political intrigue which exists largely to provide one character a chance to scowl and flip his fur cloak dramatically every time he appears on screen <>
thank heavens for the occasional anarchic battle scene to remind us that this is in fact an adventure film <>
{0} those battle scenes certainly serve their visceral purpose perhaps enough so to please the blood n guts crowd <>
its just that the whole mess is often too busy to get down to business <>
in an early scene ibn fahdlan and his travelling companion melchisidek omar sharif meet with the norsemen for the first time <>
while buliwyf speaks in norwegian one of his men dennis storhoi translates into latin for melchisidek who then translates into arabic which we hear as english for ibn fahdlan <>
on the one hand its sort of a nice touch emphasizing the culture clash with which ibn fahdlan must contend <>
on the other hand it makes the scene such a jumble of cuts and translations that it grows dizzying <>
mctiernan has toyed with a pseudoprofound action film and wound up with only a pseudoaction film another noble effort to file in the department of token praise <>

{0} of all the benefits i have received from being a film critic i may value innocence the most <>
it may seem an odd choice of words in a profession more often associated with cynicism but it applies nonetheless <>
while the onslaught of studio publicity is impossible to avoid completely the ability to attend press screenings serves as something of a buffer against expectations <>
it was impossible for me to react to the blair witch hype since i had written my review six months before its release i never needed to guard against becoming aware of key crying gameesque plot points <>
it was possible for my viewing experience to remain relative untainted subject only to preconceived notions for which i could have no one but myself to blame <>
{0} it took the release of the sixth sense for me to realize how much that innocence can matter <>
after missing the press screening due to scheduling conflicts i became aware that this story malcolm crowe bruce willis a troubled child psychologist tries to help even more troubled yearold cole sear haley joel osment with the childs ability to see dead people contained a twist or surprise ending <>
reviews and discussions meticulously avoided revealing the specific nature of the ending but by then the damage had been done <>
i considered everything i knew about the film and made an educated guess regarding what would be revealed in its closing moments <>
then i finally caught up with the film and watched with my can i outguess the writer glasses on <>
{-1} within twenty minutes it was obvious that i had guessed correctly <>
{0} im not going to suggest that it was particularly clever of me to figure it out <>
i will suggest that i probably wouldnt have been testing my cleverness if i hadnt known there was something to be figured out <>
the simple knowledge that there was a plot point to be sussed out set me to sussing <>
and i spent as much of the film nodding to myself at the clues i recognized as i did trying to get caught up in the story <>
{0} the nature of the film made such behavior both a blessing and a curse <>
writerdirector m night shyamalans pacing is so agonizingly deliberate that i was delighted to have something else on which to train my attention <>
conversely i was able to give bruce williss monotonous performance a bit more benefit of the doubt and admire the craft which allowed shyamalans little trick to seem plausible <>
the only constant to draw me from my reverie was osment a sublimely effective child actor whose performance alone is enough to recommend the sixth sense <>
children in jeopardy are usually a narrative cheat but osments reactions to his situation are always more compelling than shyamalans few moments of thriller gimmickry <>
the irony is that my connection with coles plight was consistently undercut by my awareness that the films payoff would focus on someone else <>
{-1} perhaps my longstanding aversion to physicianhealthyself psychologistpsychiatrist characters coincidentally sparked by another willis film the ghastly color of night turned me off to malcolm as an equal player in the story <>
perhaps the supernaturally comforting closing shot reminded me too much of ghost <>
perhaps the big emotional moment for toni collette as coles mother felt like a cheat because her character hadnt been developed at all <>
or perhaps i never bought the entire arc of malcolms story from the outset <>
its hard for me to know whether it was the film itself or my constant view of its wires which left me unimpressed <>
{-1} the success of the sixth sense suggests that it has struck an emotional chord in many viewers <>
for me the only chords it could strike were technical <>
there was a notparticularlyinspired gag often used by titanic detractors during its theatrical run something along the lines of whats the point you know the boats going to sink <>
most of the time its even true <>
next time i hope i dont go into a film knowing whether or not the boat is going to sink <>

{-2} kevin williamson needs to remember why he was in a position to direct a film in the first place <>
on the big screen williamson made buckets of money for dimension films by writing scream and scream on television he helped raise the wb networks profile by creating dawsons creek <>
in both cases he managed the nifty trick of subverting the conventions of a genre teen horror and teen angst melodrama respectively while still satisfying the traditional audience for each <>
teaching mrs tingle an early williamson script dusted off for his first stint in the directors chair seems to have been written before williamson figured out tone and avoiding cliches <>
as a teen drama its soggy and predictable as a thriller its a soggy and predictable teen drama as a comedy its a soggy and predictable teen drama <>
{0} williamsons dawson ingenue katie holmes stars as leigh ann watson a high school senior counting on her academic excellence to get her out of her deadend small town <>
standing in her way is mrs tingle helen mirren a nightmarish history teacher from whom no one is safe <>
when an innocent leigh ann is caught in a compromising position with a stolen final exam mrs tingle appears ready and eager to destroy her <>
leigh anns best friend jo lynn marisa coughlan and surly stud luke barry watson have other ideas however and pay mrs tingle a home visit <>
that visit soon goes dreadfully wrong ending with mrs tingle tied to her own bed and the three students seeking a way out of the mess <>
{-2} you might be expecting a dark satirical comedy from that setup or perhaps a humorlaced thriller <>
either choice might have salvaged teaching mrs tingle which instead opts for absurd sincerity <>
williamson is careful to place leigh anns anxieties and moral quandaries at the forefront of every scene delving into her insecurities at being the daughter of a single mother waitress an uncredited lesley ann warren <>
holmes is an appealing actress <>
but shes stuck looking pensive and wounded much of the time thinking deep thoughts while the soundtrack blares with angsty rock <>
her ostensible growth from timid schoolgirl to selfassured woman is the heart of the film and a frighteningly weak heart it is <>
introspection and depth of character has rarely felt such a bore or so wildly inappropriate <>
{-2} sadly the same could be said for helen mirrens performance as mrs tingle <>
at the outset shes the manifestation of every high school survivors nightmares of unforgiving instructors <>
mirren goes for the jugular with every line and she has some fantastic moments <>
williamson unfortunately isnt sure quite what to do with her <>
at times shes an inhuman demon smacking luke around and returning from the dead like michael meyers <>
at other times shes an insidious hannibal lecterlike psychological gameplayer or an object of ridicule when the teens discover her dominatrix relationship with the football coach jeffrey tambor <>
and in the final worst possible decision she becomes a vaguely pathetic victim of her own tormented past <>
the many sides of eve tingle dont add up to a multifaceted character <>
they add up to confusion <>
{-2} williamsons inability to figure out mrs tingle is exemplary of his inability to figure out much of anything in the film <>
the farcical gags with tambors masochistic coach are overplayed especially when juxtaposed with leigh anns sympathy for the coachs unsuspecting wife <>
only marisa coughlan truly emerges unscathed sparking her every scene as the theatrical jo lynn <>
coughlans funky energy and williamsons fairly effective pacing keep inspiring the hope that something entertaining will be just around the corner <>
instead theres only a sortofthriller a notquitecomedy and a story ultimately about how someone learns an important lesson in selfacceptance and not to steal her best pals guy <>
even when hes flopping williamson is still subverting genre expectations <>
hes taken a provocative dark comedy thriller and turned it into mush <>

{0} in the bowels of a thai prison two american girls learn about the horrors of bad judgment the hard way <>
alice marano claire danes and darlene davis kate beckinsale two high school grads from suburban ohio had only intended their trip to thailand as a final precollege fling <>
that was before australian seducer nick parks daniel lapaine played them for suckers and set them up as heroin smugglers <>
now in the first year of a year sentence alice and darlene are beginning to discover what damnation really means <>
it means vaguely drab pixie haircuts heavily filtered sunlight streaming into an exercise yard and a nonstop soundtrack from some technothai concept of lilith fair <>
truly this is hell on earth <>
{-1} jonathan kaplans brokedown palace is one of those gritty issue dramas that stabs itself in the heart by assuming the audiences sensibilities can only handle so much grit <>
the opening half hour works well enough following the two friends on their early youthful adventures and establishing the basic framework of their relationship <>
alice the instigator makes all the daring choices darlene the goodgirl follower plays along with her best pals caprices <>
danes doesnt go overboard with her character keeping alices devilish streak within the realm of rebellious plausibility <>
while beckinsale struggles a bit more with darlenes naivete <>
when nick enters the picture submerged jealousies begin to surface establishing how easily a lifelong friendship can be strained <>
it may not be particularly inspired storytelling but its solid enough <>
{-2} then the girls become inmates and the whole thing falls apart <>
the theme of brokedown palace may not be look at the squalor of thai prisons but it shouldnt have been look how attractive a thai prison can be with the right cinematography <>
kaplan shoots bridge sequences as elaborate music videos turning his actresses into cute models instead of tormented characters <>
meanwhile the various government officials who sneer and smirk their way through the film including kay tong lim as a corrupt thai detective and lou diamond phillips in a gruesomely bad performance as a nonchalant us embassy flunkie provide the tidy villainy we require <>
with a script by firsttime screenwriter david arata that forgets subplots and provides simplistic outrage brokedown palace proves itself to be fairly lazy filmmaking <>
it predigests its story into overwrought melodrama <>
{-1} theres a hint of promise when bill pullman enters the story as yankee hank an expatriate american attorney with that typically expatriate american sense of mefirstism <>
its fairly obvious from the getgo that his character arc will be straight out of casablanca a jaded pseudorick blaine who gives up his own financial interest for the greater good but pullman is an interesting enough actor to pull it off <>
unfortunately his story also pulls us away from the two central characters <>
though in a way thats a good thing the fewer scenes spent in the meticulously unpleasant prison the better <>
its also a distraction from alices theoretically central conversion to selfless friend <>
{-2} comparisons between brokedown palace and last years return to paradise are inevitable both are tales of americans languishing abroad seasoned with selfsacrifice for the sake of a friend <>
but as uneven as return to paradise was it approached every similar point with more provocative shades of gray <>
instead of return to paradises two casual acquaintances the friends are best buddies from the cradle making the choice considerably less complicated instead of making the protagonist convincingly selfish from the outset it makes her a misunderstood wild child <>
kaplan and arata want desperately for the plight of their characters to matter but the final hour is too irretrievably phony to provide an emotional pull <>
viewers who find this sort of morality play uplifting may find their hearts swelling at the conclusion <>
i found mine sinking as brokedown palace closed on the beatific smile of an actress placed center stage while a wellplaced beam of sunlight captured her soaring spirit in an mtv prison <>

{0} by any objective standard assuming the term isnt meaningless as it applies to film criticism detroit rock city is pretty inexcusable stuff <>
the humor sticks fairly consistently to drugs alcohol and other undesirable teen behavior <>
the catholic church is a constant target for insults with priests variously portrayed as larcenous or lecherous <>
the four principal characters have little or no personality and arent terribly sympathetic <>
its a frantically paced effort the infantile gags thrown around with a quantity beats quality mentality <>
a sensible adult human being clearly would be welladvised to hurl himself as far from this film as possible <>
{0} unless of course that adult human being happens to have been a member of the kiss army in <>
thats when this nostalgic teen comedy is set sending its four garage bandmate protagonists hawk edward furlong jam sam huntington trip james debello and lex giuseppe andrews on a trip from their ohio home to detroit where they will do anything to score tickets to a concert by the band they adore kiss <>
the quartet find themselves caught up in various rowdy misadventures as they try to get into the cobo hall show including feuding with discolovers entering strip contests and trying to escape the wrath of jams fanatically religious mother lin shaye <>
{1} director adam rifkin certainly took many of his cues for detroit rock city from the seminal film about high schoolers desperately seeking tickets to a hot bands concert paul bartels ramones lovein rock n roll high school <>
there are far worse models for a film of this kind <>
detroit rock city is a dumb film but its a dumb film with such high energy and such a shamelessly lowbrow sensibility that it feels like exactly the kind of film american pie wanted to be <>
teenage viewers may be content to snigger at the sex drugs and rock n roll gags but the cartoonish delivery of those gags makes them more fun than they have any right to be <>
{0} then again i viewed detroit rock city through some fairly rosetinted spectacles <>
though sporadically guffawinducing as a teen sex farce its far more appealing as a pure nostalgia trip for a something exheadbanger <>
the soundtrack though heavy on the kiss tunes also delivers blue oyster cult cheap trick thin lizzy and the aforementioned ramones not to mention the occasional disco selection <>
the s icons track tapes stretch armstrong action figures and farrah fawcett posters among them set just the right atmosphere <>
but carl v dupres script is best appreciated by those who spent their adolescence fighting off the scorn of the kiss sucks contingent playing air guitar to ace frehley solos and dreaming of attending a true rock spectacle <>
its filled with throwaway kiss references only a true fan could love like trips ironic prei was made for lovin you insistence that kiss would never do some bull disco song <>
in all the ways that count you really did have to be there <>
{-1} it would be easy enough to begin and end with the idea that i was bored andor repulsed by detroit rock city annoyed by the projectile vomiting humor and the limp dialogue <>
i could rightly acknowledge my frustration with setups designed mostly to work teenage boys into a lather of lust or disgust <>
and i could note that while the performers work hard to be appealing theres just not much appealing about the characters <>
when it comes right down to it the four teens are just types representations of everyone who wanted to go to a kiss concert so bad they could taste the flashpot smokeguys like me for instance <>
detroit rock city isnt a good film <>
but its a film i couldnt resist <>
as hard as it is under the best of circumstances to watch a film objectively its even harder when youre watching the story of your life <>

[19802/6]
{1} this may be a first in my six years as a film critic im going to give the bulk of the credit for a films success to the casting director <>
the film is dick a politicalhistorical satire with a sporadically amusing script and competent enough direction in short the stuff of fairly average entertainment <>
if dick pushes over the edge of averageness its because the cast dives into the material with such gusto that the film finds sparks of inspired comedy <>
casting director pam dixon mickelson has stocked dick with such a wealth of talent that its fun just watching them stroll into the shot <>
{0} the premise is silly highconcept stuff centered around two high school best friends in washington dc circa simpleminded arlene lorenzo michelle williams and even more simpleminded betsy jobs kirsten dunst <>
through exaggerated circumstances the girls become witnesses to the breakin at the watergate hotel though they have no idea what theyve seen <>
bob haldeman dave foley however isnt so sure and thinks it would be a good idea to keep an eye on the girls to determine what they know <>
thus arlene and betsy find themselves official dogwalkers for president nixon dan hedaya himself welcomed into the inner circle at the white house <>
as the watergate scandal unfolds the girls find themselves involved in virtually every key event while generally remaining blissfully unaware that theyre making history <>
{-1} the gag is pretty thin to begin with and its not even particularly original <>
dick s insistence on plopping the two teens into every pivotal moment of the second nixon administration turns it into a distaff forrest gump some marijuanalaced brownies lead to fruitful armslimitation talks with brezhnev a recorded message from the girls turns into an minute gap a wellplaced scolding leads to the resignation of john dean jim breuer their encounters with woodward will ferrell and bernstein bruce mcculloch turn them into deep throat <>
its all good for a few knowing chuckles but once you tune into the pattern you can see virtually every joke coming from several minutes away <>
{1} what you cant necessarily see coming is the appeal of the performances <>
the key players in the administration are all played with zest by a wonderful comic cast hedaya as a tragically unhip nixon harry shearer as a paranoid g gordon liddy breuer as the guiltstricken john dean saul rubinek as an insecure henry kissinger <>
more entertaining still are ferrell and mcculloch as woodward and bernstein playing the two reporters as feuding glory hounds with a relationship somewhere between sibling rivals and closeted lovers <>
and in the middle of this whos who of sketch comedy alumni michelle williams and kirsten dunst have tremendous fun with their ditzy characters <>
dunst may be the more accomplished actress of the two but its williams who gets the juicier part of a teen who develops a secret crush on nixon <>
theres nothing quite as incongruously funny as arlenes fantasy of a scowling dick riding across a beach on a white stallion <>
{0} it would have been nice if andrew fleming and sheryl longins script had found more scenes to match that one for sheer goofiness value <>
too often it gets a bit lazy opting for yet another historical couldabeen or one of many comic uses of the name dick <>
dick hits a few dead spots <>
but whenever it starts to lag it gets a jolt from the energetic cast <>
remember the name pam dixon mickelson if you happen to be casting a comedy any time soon <>
its nice to have someone who can gather an allstar team for the comedic equivalent of slowpitch softball <>

[19735/6]
{-1} of all the reasons to be frustrated by a film ill take the one mystery men provides its just too clever and original for its own damned good <>
the superhero action film has become such a predictable package of action sequences limp quips and bland characterizations that it was screaming for a satirical treament <>
to fill this need along comes mystery men spinning out a dozen different ways to turn the genre on its earwhich turns out to be at least a halfdozen too many <>
as busily directed by television commercial auteur kinka usher mystery men rarely sits still long enough for any one of its sharp ideas to turn into inspired comedy <>
{0} the concept based on characters appearing in dark horse comics offers plenty of potential <>
in champion city a teeming blade runneresque metropolis we meet three wouldbe warriors for justice mr furious ben stiller the shoveler william h macy and the forkwielding blue raja hank azaria <>
unfortunately the trio is way down in the superhero pecking order from the dashing captain amazing greg kinnear and even captain amazing cant find a good fight because hes dispatched evildoers so efficiently <>
when captain amazing engineers the release of archvillain cassanova frankenstein geoffrey rush from a mental institution he finds himself unexpectedly captured by his nemesis <>
with captain amazing out of commission its left to mr furious and his crew to bring together a team of heroes with more ambition than superfirepower including the bowler janeane garofolo master of flatulence the spleen paul reubens invisible boy kel mitchell and the terribly mysterious sphinx wes studi <>
{1} mystery men works best from the outset by turning its superheroes into analogs for contemporary athletes <>
career minorleaguers like the shoveler a married suburban father of three wonder whether theyll get a shot at the big time captain amazing and his publicist ricky jay find themselves generally more preoccupied with maintaining corporate sponsorship deals than with crimefighting <>
the simple moments in which the heroesinwaiting cope with workaday life are sparked by the wonderfully offbeat cast azarias blue raja as a mamas boy who practices his witty oneliners in his room stillers mr furious trying to strike the right superhero image to impress a diner waitress claire forlani <>
every so often mystery men nails the absurdity of its premise so well that the comedy is blissfully perfect <>
{-1} its just not often enough <>
as the film winds its way through two hours its comic highlights are nearly matched by the unexplored subplots <>
lost in the shuffle of too many characters are the teams two overeager tagalongs the geeky spleen and earnest invisible boy whose powers may be nothing more than a major case of teenage existential angst <>
neil cuthberts script spends too much time on the sphinxs initially amusing yodalike training and too little on kinnears splendidly smug captain amazing <>
rushs cassanova frankenstein hardly gets a moment to develop a distinct personality treating his teutonic accent as sufficient evidence of his villainy <>
and director usher takes the swooping fullscreen closeups from his taco bell chihuahua and got milk ads and uses them to distracting excess <>
mystery men wants to make every possible gag about superheroes in one film but its off on the next setup before you get a chance to appreciate the last punch line <>
{1} thankfully there are just enough quirky pleasures in mystery men to counteract its hyperactivity <>
some bits of dialogue are priceless including the shovelers stubborn insistence that millionaire lance hunt couldnt be captain amazings alterego lance hunt wears glasses captain amazing doesnt <>
the teams first joint assault on cassanovas limo is a goofy lowtech triumph over the bad guys followed by a round of drinks at a bar like a city league softball team <>
a cast like stiller garofalo macy and azaria guarantees more oddball enjoyment than most films could deliver but they could have been part of a cult classic <>
its ironic that a parody of summer movie overkill is guilty of some of the same sins <>
you cant swing for the fences every time especially if youre a minor leaguer trying to make it to the show <>
sometimes youve gotta take one for the team <>

[19529/8]
{0} trick is one of those rare gay romantic comedies that passes the straight test <>
as films with gay themes became more prevalent in recent years they began to blur together <>
filmmakers appeared to think that the mere act of putting a samesex couple on the screen made the film praiseworthy often failing to introduce much that was entertaining on its own merits <>
thus was born my straight test which allowed for a fairly quick barometer of quality would anyone pay the slightest attention to the same story if the two principal characters were a man and a woman <>
{1} jim falls bright fun frisky comedy not only passes the straight test it makes plenty of straight romantic comedies look positively inept by comparison <>
christian campbell stars as gabriel an aspiring musicalcomedy composer who spends his days working temp jobs and his nights feeding the ego of his best girlfriendaspiring singer katherine tori spelling <>
that doesnt leave much time to find love let alone a onenight stand until a trip to a bar introduces gabriel to mark j p pitoc a sexy gogo dancer <>
they make plans for a night of simple sex but plans go awry when every opportunity to be alone is thwarted <>
as the evening progresses and gabriel and mark get better acquainted simple sex begins to seem less interesting though also less complicated than the prospect of a more serious relationship <>
{2} tricks singleday structure may be something of a trick in itself yet theres rarely a moment when jason schafers screenplay feels forced or contrived <>
sure it falls back on humor from drag queens and cabaret performances <>
both devices also happen to produce two of tricks funniest scenes a spanishlanguage ode to the singers male member and advice from a man made up to bear a startling resemblance to one of the cast members <>
in fact as pure comedy trick rarely stumbles <>
every character gets wonderful moments sparked by the kind of dialogue woody allen used to produce in his prime <>
even tori spelling yes i said tori spelling is a revelation as the blissfully selfabsorbed katherine particularly throwing her talents behind a performance of gabriels composition enter you <>
when a director can turn spelling into a gifted comic actress you know hes a talent to watch for <>
{2} i suppose the reason trick is even more appealing than its laugh value is that it does more with a gay relationship than any film i can remember <>
thats probably because it isnt just about a gay relationship <>
the adorably dimpled christian campbell brother of screams neve makes for an appealing protagonist because hes so recognizably human in his relationship anxieties <>
the developing relationshp between gabriel and mark works the way all good romantic relationships work exploring the way people discover surprisingly wonderful things about each other when they least expect it <>
the fact that the relationship develops in the midst of such entertaining comedy is a delightful bonus <>
the obstacles thrown in their way do begin to feel a bit contrived but you may be having too much fun to notice <>
trick is so effortlessly charming i may just change the name of the straight test to the trick test <>

[19475/4]
{-1} its too bad there couldnt have been a bit more distance between the release of the blair witch project and the making of the haunting then at least director jan de bont wouldnt have had an excuse <>
with recent history to consider it may have made a perverse economic sense to turn shirley jacksons supremely creepy story into a special effectsfilled funhouse <>
then along comes blair witch to prove that you can still rattle an audience with what might be happening rather than a computergenerated representation of what is happening <>
ironically blair witch owes a debt to the original version of the haunting in its study of the psychology of fear <>
sadly the haunting circa owes a debt to jan twister speed de bont in its study of thickheaded filmmaking <>
{0} an even more bitter irony is that this version of the haunting gathers its characters for a study of the psychology of fear <>
researcher jeffrey marrow liam neeson brings together three subjects for an experiment telling them only that its a study of insomnia <>
his actual goal is to examine mounting fear and paranoia by placing his trio of volunteers in the creepy hill house a mammoth manor with a dark history <>
nell lili taylor theo catherine zetajones and luke owen wilson all soon experience strange phenomena but it is the emotionally fragile nell who experiences them most strongly <>
she comes to believe that the spirits of tormented children haunt hill house and that she must play a special role in quieting those spirits <>
{0} its fairly clear from the start that the real star of the haunting is the house itself <>
de bont sprinkles the film liberally with sweeping helicopter shots of the sprawling exterior he prowls through the bending hallways and pans across cavernous great rooms he lets cinematographer caleb deschanel bathe the ornate bedrooms in muted oranges and reds <>
eugenio zanettis production design is certainly eyecatching offering more detail than one could possibly absorb in one sitting <>
but at a certain point the sprawling staginess of the house starts to work against the film <>
it begins to feel like disneys haunted mansion crossed with the winchester mystery house a tourist attraction designed more for spooky giggles than for genuine shivers <>
{-1} once the house fails to deliver the creepiness youre left with the treatment of the material which is literalist to the mundane extreme <>
robert wises the haunting was hardly perfect julie harris handwringing fussiness took her nell too far over the edge from the start <>
but it began from the principle that fear is about anticipation not revelation <>
de bont has no interest in any such subtleties <>
instead of making a film about the way an environment of terror is more powerful in imagination than in reality he makes a film about faces appearing in pillowcases leaping skeletons windows that turn into big staring eyeballs and living statues a la ray harryhausen <>
every bit of subtext is either turned into inyourface text claire blooms ambiguously flirtatious theo in the original becomes catherine zetajones hi im a bisexual theo or abandoned a key piece of hill house backstory about a tormented caretaker similar to nell <>
with its foundationshaking finale and monstrous apparitions this isnt a remake of the haunting its a remake of poltergeist <>
{-2} of course theres a place for the poltergeists of cinema <>
generally however it helps if that sort of film can tap into something primal like scary clowns or menacing trees <>
the haunting cant really be classified as a horror film because theres nothing remotely horrifying about it unless you count the inanely expository dialogue eg a character reacting to a stairway collapsing look the stairway is collapsing <>
in fact its often downright laughable sometimes intentionally owen wilsons goofball performance sometimes not a blissedout otherworldly ending that makes ghost look restrained <>
de bont has made a film from the school of quips and money shots all flash and chuckle <>
hes merely interested in showing off his bigbudget toys so everyone can see the thing that goes oogabooga <>
thats a pretty limp take on a tale of the oogaboogas inside our heads <>

[19458/6]
{0} its tough to knock a funny film for being not nearly as funny as it could have been or thinks it is but thats ultimately the problem with drop dead gorgeous <>
using that increasinglypopular device of the faux documentary it tells the behindthescenes story of a regional beauty pageant in the small town of mount rose minnesota <>
town grand dame gladys leeman kirstie alley is one of the organizers of the local miss teen princess america competition but she also happens to be the mother of contestant becky leeman denise richards <>
that gives becky a distinct edge though she faces her toughest challenge from tapdancing trailer park ingenue amber atkins kirsten dunst <>
unless that is amber meets the same sort of untimely end as others who cross the leemans <>
{1} it would be easy enough to call drop dead gorgeous a secondrate gloss on michael ritchies smile or a wannabe waiting for guffman or a halfhearted the positively true adventures of the alleged texas cheerleadermurdering mom also not coincidentally directed by michael ritchie <>
such criticisms dont do justice to the number of belly laughs this film provides <>
some are exaggerated like the behavior of one judges mentally handicapped brother will sasso <>
some are subtle like the production number that finds pageant contestants smearing themselves on freshlypainted stepladders <>
and some are sharp like the smoking drinking pregnant teen who says she cant make an event because shes like due or something <>
by the time the talent portion of the competition rolls around complete with dog impressions and monologues from soylent green drop dead gorgeous has provided enough humor to avoid being buried by comparative criticism <>
{-1} the thing about those comparitive criticisms is that youd also be right <>
as scripted by lona williams herself a former minnesota beauty contest participant the film takes on too many targets to skewer any of them with maximum effectiveness <>
the peek at pageant contestants finds only the occasional insight opting instead for broad caricatures and even broader gags <>
the films smalltown setting is given a similar treatment with freakishly outrageous characters including chief overacting offenders alley and ellen barkin undercutting the more spoton observations of provincial foibles <>
in fact director michael patrick jann almost always opts for overthetop making the documentary setup seem completely inappropriate <>
its impossible to get caught up in drop dead gorgeouss verisimilitude when the action arbitrarily switches to rapidfire multipleangle edits the likes of which ive never seen in any documentary <>
{-1} its that aggravating refusal to look for genuine humor that makes drop dead gorgeous so frustrating <>
when its funny its quite entertaining <>
but theres always the suspicion that it could have been hilarious with a bit of care <>
why make the teenobsessed judge matt malloy a nervous chainsmoking cartoon character patterned after martin shorts shyster nathan thurm <>
why continue the story for fifteen minutes after the films natural climax including a vomitspewing journey to the state finals <>
why give the one recognizably human character the wonderful allison janney as ambers surrogate mother so little to do <>
every joke made in drop dead gorgeous made me think of a joke missed every raucous chuckle called to mind an even better sly snicker <>
its like a vaudeville act that will do anything to please the crowd only its a vaudeville act that thinks its a wicked satire <>
youll laugh youll sigh youll think about the better films covering similar subject matter <>
this may be one of the least satisfying entertaining films of recent years <>

{-1} this is my father is a family affair and not just because its subject matter involves family ties <>
the writerdirector is paul quinn brother of star aidan quinn both of whom are also brothers to cinematographer declan quinn with all three acting as executive producers <>
it must have seemed a warm and wonderful thing for the brothers quinn to collaborate on a tale of their homeland a paean to the importance of finding ones roots combined with the rich atmosphere of s ireland <>
so warm and wonderful was the experience evidently that no one bothered to pay much attention to telling an interesting coherent story <>
{0} this is my father is a sprawling mess of a film that tries to tell several stories each one more irritating than the last <>
the narrative opens in the present day where chicago high school teacher kieran johnson james caan is experiencing some sort of existential crisis <>
when he finds a photo and note from a man named kieran among his invalid mothers possessions he connects that malaise to never knowing his father <>
with his vaguely sullen nephew jack jacob tierney in tow kieran travels to his mothers irish hometown where an elderly resident moira deady spins him a tale circa <>
in that tale kierans mother fiona flynn moya farrelly is a highspirited yearold who catches the eye of shy farmer kieran oday aidan quinn <>
the pairing causes trouble in the town of course as religion and family objections come between fiona and kieran the elder <>
{-2} the trouble begins in this is my father with a presentday prologue that does a miserable job of setting up the premise <>
in fact the entire framing story feels like little more than a series of ridiculous contrivances <>
caans monotonously shellshocked performance offers little indication as to what his problem is how long its been going on or how its connected to his equally shellshocked sister and ill mother <>
the addition of fatherless young jack to the travelling party seems intended to provide a contemporary parallel as his own youthful romance blossoms <>
unfortunately that romance is so ridiculously apocryphal that its not clear until the last ten minutes which of two girls is supposed to be his own lovely lass <>
every moment set in the present is a wearying bore leading this viewer to a stonefaced demand that the flashback sequences better be worth it <>
{-1} theyre not <>
theyre an improvement to be certain but theres so much extraneous business going on that the central romance gets lost <>
strewn throughout the tale are a couple of curses the omnipresent institutional frown of the catholic church including a nicely creepy role for stephen rea as a fireandbrimstone priest a bit of class warfare and a cameo appearance by john cusack as an american photographer who lands his plane to play american football with kieran and fiona on a beach take the picture which will end up in kieran the youngers hands and go away <>
the romance itself ultimately makes no sense from fionas side with nary an attempt to explain why the spunky girl would be charmed by the socially inept kieran <>
aidan quinn fares better as a manchild unsure how to handle a romantic relationship but the story places too much tragic weight on his shoulders <>
this is my father wanders all over the emerald isle in search of a compelling theme or relationship and never finds one <>
{-1} i suppose the quinns may have been pointing out the generational consequences of fatherlessness through kieran oday orphaned fiona child of a widow kieran johnson and jack both with absentee fathers <>
they may have been most interested in recreating the sights and sounds of ireland <>
they may have wanted to make their own titaniclite romantic weeper complete with celtic music <>
the problem is that you really cant tell what they wanted to do with any degree of certainty <>
this is my father never pulls its two storylines together in any believable way nor manages to make either one gripping on its own terms <>
the filming may have served as a pleasant rootsexploring quinn family vacation but we the viewers are left with the tedium of watching their home movies <>

{1} its easy enough to adopt the headshaking perspective that the muppets just aint what they used to be <>
certainly the death of jim henson left a void in the muppet universe but its only fitting that the show has gone on <>
the muppet shows setting as an oldtime vaudeville revue wasnt just a goofy conceit it exemplified the whole muppet philosophy <>
sure the scattershot jokes and variety numbers could be groaners but they were delivered with such a pure desire to please that it almost didnt matter <>
the muppets were and continue to be entertainment from a bygone era where you rarely had to target kids exclusively because virtually all entertainment was family entertainment <>
{0} muppets from space is a broad silly fairly charming piece of muppet capering based on a yearold running gag exactly what is gonzo dave goelz anyway <>
stepping away from their recent literary adaptations the muppets are cast as themselves living together in one big house <>
though they appear to be a happy feltheaded family gonzo still feels isolated by his singularity <>
a possible answer comes to him in the form of a message from his alphabet breakfast cereal leading gonzo to the conclusion that he is a refugee from an alien race <>
this development grabs the attention of government operative k edgard singer jeffrey tambor who intends to use gonzo as proof of his theory that we are not alone <>
{1} the premise sets up jokes targeted at just about every aliens among us movie of the last years <>
a woman shows up with a mashed potato sculpture of gonzo a la close encounters the muppets encounter some starcameo men in black including sportsnights josh charles and wrestler hollywood hulk hogan a scene at a laboratory window recalls independence day <>
theres even a swing into the unexpected territory of the shawshank redemption as imprisoned rat rizzo steve whitmire escapes through a hole hidden behind a mice girls poster <>
sly pop culture references and slapstick carry most of the humor but theres also the simple pleasure of the company of familiar characters <>
when kermit fozzie and miss piggy lead a mission to rescue gonzo the history of those characters somehow makes every simple joke that much funnier <>
{-1} its also true that muppets from space has an inconsistent tone and a higherthanusual ratio of duds to chuckles <>
several cameo appearances fall flat including david arquette as a crazed scientist and f murray abraham as a dreamsequence noah <>
the use of a musical score full of s soul classics like brick house and celebration feels forced since the muppets are anything but funky <>
and as hard as the posthenson muppet gang has worked to make gonzo the new protagonist he just doesnt have the warmth and appeal of kermit whos now relegated to a sort of elder statesman role <>
muppets from space can keep you smiling <>
but it rarely hits the high points of classic anarchic muppet wit <>
{1} still theres enough subtly subversive humor in muppets from space as well as enough wild sight gags to make you glad the muppets are still around <>
the films best most cultural crusaderunfriendly joke finds gonzo admitting to his pals that i guess ive always had alien tendenciesthis just seems natural to me <>
those who have fretted for years that bert and ernie were actually lovers may furrow their brows at such alternative lifestyle innuendo but its a perfect nod to the kind of unconventional family the muppets have always been <>
then again thats the kind of bond theater people often form and the muppets are nothing if not true theater people <>
okay not people exactlyjust entertainers who remind you that its a good thing for the show to go on <>

{2} i see spike lee working <>
i have a pretty good idea what he was up to with summer of sam <>
this would his a saga of a more dangerous new york circa when the big apple was more famous for muggings than for musicals <>
it would be a tale of how paranoia can amplify the xenophobia that already exists in so many people <>
it would be a story of one very specific demon son of sam serial killer david berkowitz michael badalucco which also explored the demons many of us keep hidden just beneath the surface <>
it would be an examination of the uncomfortable link between the criminal and the tabloid media that exploited him <>
it would be both ambitious and intimate both a period piece and a piece of who we still are <>
it would be an important film <>
{1} i see spike lee working and i saw summer of sam workingup to a point <>
his account cowritten with victor colicchio and micheal imperioli of new yorks hot hellish summer of focuses on two bronx neighborhood buddies and their relationships <>
vinny john leguizamo is a hairdresser with trouble remaining faithful in his marriage to dionna mira sorvino ritchie adrien brody is a wouldbe punk rocker who has moved to the village and taken up with ruby jennifer esposito a neighborhood girl with a reputation <>
though they now live in different worlds vinnys a little bit studio ritchies a little bit cbgbs they remain friends <>
that friendship becomes dangerous as the summer heats up fear of the caliber killer intensifies and the guys in the neighborhood begin making their own personal lists of suspects including ritchie <>
{1} for a while the stories of lees two main characters are promising enough that summer of sam keeps you watching <>
vinny begins to disintegrate after a close encounter with the killer leaves him torn between a desire to reform and his inability to control his libido <>
ritchie meanwhile uses dancing and turning tricks at a gay club to support his drug habit and budding career his external outsider image hiding an even more outsider lifestyle <>
leguizamo is particularly strong in his role will someone please put this guys talent to good use <>
but both characters work in juxtaposition to the son of sam theyre antisocial people who happen to functionally antisocials <>
though the period production design comes and goes theres still a strong sense of this particular time and place in new york <>
we see as a more intense period in the life of the city when the thin connecting thread of rooting for the yankees was always ready to snap into violence <>

spike lee is also a filmmaker who often doesnt know when to stop himself <>

lee even opens with an extended crane shot that serves as a big flashing red light that the director wants touch of evilboogie nights respect for his project <>
its often invigorating <>
but its also an attempt to cover for a story that lets some subplots drag on forever vinny and dionnas hohum marital woes while letting others disappear just when they seem interesting anthony lapaglia as a detective with mob ties in his background <>
lee may be talented but his pure id approach to directing leads to some baffling decisions <>
{-2} no decision in summer of sam is more baffling or more harmful to the film than lees portrayal of berkowitz himself <>
it was a risky enough maneuver introducing berkowitz as a character at all rather than leaving him as a bogeyman haunting the periphery of the film it was even riskier to show him freaking out in his apartment <>
but lee goes past the point of no return when he actually shows a big black dog telling berkowitz to kill in john turturros voice lips moving like he was a refugee from babe <>
that scene turns a killers demented rampage into absurdist comedy making you wonder what the hell lee was thinking <>
clearly he had ideas spilling out of himself as he prepared for summer of sam a million different stories he wanted to tell in this one story about the naked city <>
at times it gels into a gripping film <>
at other times you can see lee workingand you can see him working far too hard <>

{-2} in my review of john sayles film lone star i wrote that my initial frustration with the film must have meant that i missed something <>
such was my confidence in sayles storytelling that i was convinced i could find the unifying thematic thread if i just pondered long enough <>
in that particular case i was right <>
sayles new film limbo presented me with the same initial frustration and the same determination to find the one piece that would turn the merely intriguing into the truly brilliant <>
and it just wasnt there <>
{1} for the first hour there are plenty of reasons to believe limbo could be the latest thematically rich cinematic sayles novel <>
the setting is port henry alaska a remote fishing town in the southeastern islands <>
among the residents is joe gastineau david strathairn a former fisherman turned jackofalltrades after a longago trauma <>
he becomes interested in new arrival donna de angelo mary elizabeth mastrantonio a singer who has her own problems dealing with moody teenage daughter noelle vanessa martinez and a string of bad romantic choices <>
as joe and donna grow closer they begin to break out of their protective shells and face their demons <>
{1} as he has with the settings of most of his recent films the secret of roan inishs coastal ireland lone stars texas border town men with guns unnamed latin american interior sayles turns limbos alaska into a character as carefully drawn as any of the people <>
here alaska has at least two faces the raw blankslate wilderness that provides escape and opportunity for new beginnings and the tourist attraction that provides a sanitized version of that wilderness <>
sayles offers plenty of local color with his supporting characters but its the way those characters interact with the place that gives limbo weight <>
for half the film limbo sets a tentative romance against a backdrop of civilization trying to claim one of the few remaining frontiers even as residents who should know better keep searching for a predictability that just isnt there <>
{-1} i suppose you could see the second half as sayles attempt to show just how far civilization has to go if you were feeling particularly generous <>
an abrupt twist in the proceedings finds our three principal characters in trouble stranded on an uninhabited island after a botched drug deal by joes hustling halfbrother bobby casey siemaszko <>
the metaphorical connections to the three characters respective troubles are a bit too tidy <>
joe has two people to save after being responsible for two deaths donna is stuck with a guy she cant run from and vanessa has to confront her sense of isolation <>
even worse the links to the first halfs portrait of alaska at a cultural crossroads become tenuous at best <>
the second half is solid enough <>
but its a jarring shift <>
instead of a novel sayles has written two short stories slammed together in an uncomfortable fit <>
{-2} john sayles films are always comparative pleasures in the bigger picture of filmmaking with their smart dialogue and attention to human detail <>
strathairn mastrantonio and martinez all do fine work with mastrantonio providing the added pleasure of performing her own songs in a beautiful smoky voice <>
sayles has also become a more visually interesting director with every film turning in at least one hypnotically beautiful sequence of joe returning to fishing another triumph for cinematographer haskell wexler <>
he can say fascinating things both with his dialogue and his camera <>
in limbo all those fascinating things just dont add up to a fascinating unified story <>
limbo isnt a disappointment because he doesnt say enough as in the ambiguous final shot <>
its a disappointment because he tries to say too much <>

[19040/4]
{-1} as alleged harbingers of the apocalypse go adam sandler hardly seems worth the consternation <>
sure hes a comedian with a routine based primarily on silly voices screaming and the broadest of broad humor <>
hes also just the latest in a long tradition of anarchic adolescent doofus humor a tradition with forebears like the three stooges jerry lewis robin williams and jim carrey <>
a clown doing poopoo jokes can still be a pretty entertaining clown which sandler has done with sporadic effectiveness in his previous films <>
{0} in big daddy sandler wants to be one of those laughing on the outside crying on the inside clowns and plugs himself into a sentimental irritatingly generic high concept comedy <>
sandler plays sonny koufax a yearold law school graduate who has decided that laying around living off a big personal injury settlement is better than practicing law <>
his irresponsibility is beginning to wear on his longtime girlfriend kristy swanson leading sonny to contemplate a life change <>
the opportunity comes when yearold julian dylan and cole sprouse the heretofore unknown son of sonnys roommate kevin jon stewart shows up at the door <>
with kevin on a business trip in china sonny decides to become julians surrogate father a job he quickly realizes his more difficult than he anticipated <>
{-1} and therein the laughs ensue at least every once in a while <>
sonnys laissezfaire parenting style produces plenty of scenes in which julian urinates in some public place wears outrageous clothes or repeats profanities in his cuterthancute widdle boy voice <>
some are funny some are groanworthy <>
and some just feel a little icky as a troubled child is turned into a prop <>
its easier to latch on to the funny however when sandler is the irresponsible idbeast we all know and love screaming out his dismay over missing mcdonalds breakfast eating cereal in front of the television slapping newspapers over julians wet bed like the boy was a puppy <>
sandler as a longlost stooge a la the waterboy is where his mischievous personality works best <>
{-1} sandler as a wouldbe actor expanding his range with touching personal relationships and gentle romantic banter is a huge miscalculation <>
his previous attempt at broadening his audience last years the wedding singer was successful because it remained rooted in silliness and never got excessively mawkish <>
big daddy is the very epitome of mawkishness full of cutesypie chats with love interest joey lauren adams and sadeyed fatherson moments all set to teddy castelluccis syrupy string score <>
worse yet its a film into which any one of several dozen actors could have been plugged with no change <>
its a film in which the gags are just impediments to the protagonist learning his important life lesson <>
sandler with his smirky grin and schoolyard hostility always looks like hed rather be learning how to play a nintendo game <>
{0} there are a few nice comic touches in big daddy from steve buscemis turn as an oddball homeless guy to a perfect fauxbarney kiddie video <>
there are also plenty of irritating touches like rob schneiders indiscriminately middle eastern delivery guy and the pounditintotheground references to hooters <>
big daddy is the sort of film where it becomes easy to pick on lazy inconsistencies like a televised nhl game announced as crucial to the standings despite the fact that the film takes place in october the first month of the nhl season <>
if sandler worried about keeping us laughing and understood hes more fun to watch when he is a child than when he has one there wouldnt be enough time to get bogged down in the cheap emotions or sloppy writing <>
maybe some day hell realize how much better off he is in the happy gilmores of his career when the french get around to labeling him a comic genius <>

[18944/4]
{0} the generals daughter will probably be the cleverest stupid film well see this year or perhaps the stupidest clever film <>
its confusing to a critic when so much knuckleheaded plotting and ostentatious direction shares the screen with <>
so much snappy dialogue and crisp character interaction <>
that however is what happens when legendary screenwriter william goldman takes a pass at an otherwise brutally predictable conspiracy thriller <>
the punchedup punch lines are ever on the verge of convincing you the generals daughter has a brain in its head <>
even as the remaining of the narrative punches you in the face with its lack of common sense <>
{0} our hero is warrant officer paul brenner a brash investigator for the u s armys criminal investigation division <>
his latest case is the murder of captain elisabeth campbell leslie stefanson at a georgia base the victim found tied to the ground after an apparent sexual assault and strangulation <>
complicating the case is the fact that capt campbell is the daughter of general joe campbell james cromwell a war hero and potential vicepresidential nominee <>
general campbell wants to keep the case out of the press which gives brenner only the hours before the fbi steps in <>
teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill madeleine stowe who coincidentally enough once had a romantic relationship with brenner brenner begins uncovering dark secrets from the late captains past that make the case ever more sordid <>
{-1} if only the sordidness were the worst of the generals daughters problems <>
scenes of sexual degredation do linger much longer than necessary their negligible dramatic value overwhelmed by filteredlight sleaze <>
director simon west likely thinks hes covered himself by juxtaposing these images of violence with sweet flowers but all he does is prove himself dependent on visual cliches which is the films fatal flaw <>
its a trend he continues for two hours taking the storys few virtues and slapping a coat of moronproof obviousness over them <>
characters who may wink wink turn out to be villains are photographed in ominous shadow cutaway inserts of the captain campbells stillliving face after the corpse is uncovered insure against fiveminute attention spans <>
west just cant help himself from overdirecting every minute of the generals daughter <>
he even turns a scene of footage shown on cnn into an excuse for slowfade edits <>
{1} bubbling up from this overcooked stew are enough tasty lines to distract you from its smell <>
the slickest scene finds brenner squaring off with captain campbells mentor a psychological warfare expert named moore james woods <>
theres something invigorating about watching two smart actors playing smart characters firing honesty at one another <>
indeed travolta gets to sink his teeth into dozens of choice lines based on his delight at provoking authority figures to the local sheriff of the georgia county shouldnt you be out nightsticking the colored folk <>
even the lame device of brenner and sunhills sexual history provides a few winning zingers <>
goldmans dialogue can serve up a bigger laugh than youll find in most socalled comedies <>
{-1} dialogue unfortunately just isnt enough to make a quality script <>
its difficult to take a movie about a criminal investigation seriously when the investigators are both too stupid to solve it sooner an idiotic inability to recognize the nature of the crime scene and too lucky for it to last any longer not one but two occasions where brenner catches a vital piece of evidence out of the corner of his eye <>
by the time the generals daughter wanders towards its overwrought psychointherain finale wests heavy hand has obliterated most of what made the film occasionally fun <>
its silly and pretentious filmmaking <>
but at least it provides a giggle or five <>
goldman should tear the decent pages out of this script and turn them into a standup routine <>

[18923/6]
{2} an ideal husband is so determinedly droll that its likely to leave your cheeks aching from a sustained minute smirk <>
that shouldnt be a tremendous shock considering were talking about a play by oscar wilde whose penchant for the tres bon mot was matched only by his curious desire to cobble them together into plots <>
he was smart enough to craft his stories into a crowdpleasing romantic form <>
but he was generally less interested in emotional insight than he was in a witty turn of phrase <>
in the mouths of actors who know how to use them his epigrams can make you forget that the narrative youre watching is fairly forgettable <>
{1} there are many such actors in an ideal husband enough to give the tale some devilish fun <>
jeremy northam essays sir robert chiltern an upandcoming member of parliament in wellknown for his integrity the everradiant cate blanchett is his wife gertrude who places her husband on a pedestal of moral rectitude <>
theres julianne moore as mrs chevely who knows a dark secret from sir roberts past and expects political favors for her silence and minnie driver as sir roberts highspirited younger sister mabel <>
and foremost there is rupert everett as rakish bachelor lord arthur goring the very portrait of slothful privilege and the dispenser of wildes most cutting social commentary <>
{-1} director oliver parker who also adapted the screenplay works at fleshing out the relationships in the story trying to make the crisis in the chilterns marriage more significant <>
its a noble idea <>
though the time isnt particularly wellspent <>
northam broods as he faces his moment of truth blanchett melts in disappointment over dashed illusions and both actors attempt to show us deep internal turmoil <>
parker wants us to feel for them while i suspect wilde is more interested in making them look a bit foolish <>
playing the characters with too much sincerity may be too heavy a reading of the material <>
{2} fortunately parker still has plenty of juicy wildeian dialogue to distribute <>
much of it goes to everetts sir arthur who bites into his commentaries on marriage politics and deception with relish <>
many actors have opted to play wilde with an eyebrow arched into the flight path passenger jets as though we all must know they view life itself as a grand joke <>
everett smartly opts for a refined weariness the cynicism of a man who doesnt take much pleasure in his cynicism <>
its a choice that makes his later romance with mabel played with beautiful intelligence by driver feel less like a plot device than it has any right to <>
when everett and driver banter an ideal husband floats on their appeal <>
{1} its true that a little droll can go an awfully long way and that an ideal husband hardly offers a riveting portrait of scandal and redemption <>
mostly its a comedy of manners one of wildes forrays into the difference between our public and private faces a subject with which he was well acquainted <>
though parkers pacing lags between gags <>
there is just enough surprisingly modern satire and just enough rupert everett to maintain interest <>
the chuckles may rarely turn into belly laughs but then again that never was wildes style <>
an ideal husband is the work of a writer who preferred his comedy on wry <>

[18659/4]
{-1} there was a sense of dejavu developing long before i actually saw instinct inspired by the presentation of the basic premise in the trailers <>
here was anthony hopkins playing a brilliant scientist turned hairtrigger madman turning the tables on a confident young interviewer trying to get inside his head <>
i couldnt help but think id seen this somewhere before <>
then i saw the film and it all became clear <>
this wasnt just a case of hopkins flexing his hannibal lecter muscles again before taking on the film version of thomas harris recentlypublished sequel to the silence of the lambs <>
he was simply keeping pace with a story that slaps together characters situations and exact shots from dozens of other films <>
{-1} instinct is a sloppy derivative drama focusing on the interaction between primatologist dr ethan powell hopkins and psychiatric resident dr theo caulder cuba gooding jr <>
powell a oncenoted expert on gorillas is now a mute inmate in a prison psychiatric ward after murdering two men in the jungle of rwanda caulder an ambitious upandcomer sees interviewing powell for a compentency evaluation as his ticket to professional stardom <>
powell eventually does open up to caulder but only because he has a message to relate <>
in flashback we see powell becoming ever more connected to the family of gorillas he is studying until he is accepted as one of them <>
his experience leads him to a realization about the nature of human behavior in the world a lesson he intends to impart on his impromptu pupil caulder <>
{-2} you could spend a productive day doing little more than ticking off the films from which instinct cribs one flew over the cuckoos nest gorillas in the mist tarzan the shawshank redemption and even dead poets society in addition to the silence of the lambs <>
gerald dipegos script plods along dropping its familiar cinematic tropes like bread crumbs leading the audience to its responses <>
theres the psychiatrist whos really more confused than his patient the prison guard john ashton whose casual sadism is treated as a bona fide job requirement and the collection of mental patients who become lovable comic relief <>
theres even a scene of confounding idiocy in which we the kneejerking audience are supposed to cheer for caulder irresponsibly whipping a room full of jailed psychotics into a rebellious frenzy <>
instinct is so gruellingly predictable that you may be surprised momentarily when powells daughter maura tierney doesnt become a love interest for caulder until you realize that this is just a slightly different more insulting cliche a black man and a white woman are allowed to be just friends <>
{1} somehow in the midst of so much uninspired tripe anthony hopkins still manages to come through with a performance thats invigorating to watch <>
sure its a spin on hannibal lecter but its more fiercely intelligent than anything the rest of the film can deliver <>
you cant help but lean forward when you hear that seductive baritone you cant help but shudder when caulders neck hinges on the correct answer to a very tricky question <>
hopkins makes instinct better <>
he also makes it worse because everything else looks even more workmanlike notably cuba gooding jrs performance <>
gooding is all facial twitches and exposition explaining the tremendous change in his life wrought by powell <>
a little economy and subtlety skills hopkins demonstrates even when playing a wild man could have served gooding well <>
{-1} sadly subtlety is one thing instinct has in very short supply <>
even viewers prepared to sympathize with the films fuzzy embrace of the state of nature will find this more a philosophical tract albeit one with remarkably realistic animatronic apes by stan winston than a compelling drama <>
we all know man badanimals good which makes the decision to turn the humans into cartoonish villains even more perplexing <>
if there were a moment of real insight into a character the rest of instincts brainless cinematic thievery might have been more tolerable <>
instead it lets breathing plot devices gab at one another for two hours between unnervingly familiar situations <>
thank heavens for the entertainment value of anthony hopkins gloss on films bestknown cannibal <>
its only fitting in a film that does plenty of cannibalizing of its own <>

[18607/8]
{1} many films have traced the arc of a romantic relationship in which the two principals despite initial appearances that they are a perfect pair are destined never to be happy together <>
they have been sweet annie hall sad casablanca even sordid weeks indeed they have come in virtually every possible permutation <>
the dreamlife of angels is the first film i can recall which traces the arc of a platonic friendship in the same terms <>
sparked by two superb performances in complex roles its as affecting and involving as any tale in which the doomed couple are romantic partners instead of pals <>
{0} the two pals in the dreamlife of angels meet while working at a dress factory in the french city of lille <>
isa tostin elodie bouchez is a yearold itinerant stranded without a place to stay when the friend she has coming looking for is nowhere to be found <>
marie thomas natacha gregnier is a hardedged woman living for free in the apartment of a woman and her daughter severly injured in an auto accident <>
marie invites isa to stay with her and the two kindred free spirits quickly become inseparable <>
{1} the dynamic between the two central characters works from the outset only because they are so carefully beautifully drawn by erick zonca and roger bohbot <>
the punky isa and hairtrigger marie click from their first meeting two rebels without a cent who delight in taunting bouncers at a local nightclub or coming on to random men in a mall <>
their playful irreverence makes for some entertaining scenes and allows the two lead actresses to develop a believable chemistry <>
that kind of chemistry is critical to a story about a relationship if isa and marie dont seem like ideal best friends when they first get acquainted the rest of the dreamlife of angels becomes utterly irrelevant <>
{0} its just as important that the appearance of an ideal pairing proves deceiving and the film works just as well revealing that truth <>
where isa is sincerely searching for someone with whom she can connect marie consistently sabotages every stable thing in her life <>
isa finds the diary of the comatose teenager whose room she is occupying and begins to visit the girl in the hospital while manufacturing a dialogue with her <>
marie meanwhile dumps the chubby but loving charly patrick mercado for the callow abusive chris gregoire colin and refuses to put forth an effort to land another job <>
though the psyches of the two women are perhaps too easily distilled into a brief discussion of their respective parentage bouchez and gregnier flesh out their roles as opposite sides of the same wounded coin <>
{1} the character study of the dreamlife of angels is so strong <>
that its easier to overlook its shortcomings a drawnout prologue before the two women meet underdeveloped supporting characters and a third act which takes an unnecessarily melodramatic turn <>
zoncas minimalist direction never gets in the way of the performances but it also does little to complement them <>
in fact the story might have worked even better as a twocharacter stage play <>
thats not to take anything away from the effectiveness of those characters in the film or the skilled actresses who bring them to life <>
its a thoroughly compelling exploration of female bonding and unbonding a chick flick turned on its head <>
the disintegration of a friendship has rarely felt quite so tragic <>

[18596/8]
{0} not to be glib but there are two very simple reasons why so many romantic comedies are so bad no romance no comedy <>
the structure is so simple it could be banged out by monkeys find two characters put them together introduce an obstacle tear them apart resolve the obstacle bring them back together again <>
thats where every romantic comedy script begins and sadly thats also where most of them end <>
see theres the notsosmall matter of creating two likeable characters whose pairing is as plausible as their separation as well as entertaining the audience along the way to the foregone conclusion <>
when your audience is ready and willing to be charmed a films inability to generate wit or warmth is inexcusable <>
{1} notting hill penned by four weddings and a funeral scribe richard curtis does everything a romantic comedy needs to do right <>
hugh grant plays william thacker a london bookseller living a simple if vaguely lonely life <>
that life is promptly turned upside down when anna scott julia roberts the worlds biggest female movie star walks into his shop <>
anna the hounded subject of perpetual press coverage is understandably guarded william though a bit dazzled is understated in his treatment of the star <>
though anna finds williams absence of fawning unexpectedly appealing plenty of barriers stand in the way of a potential relationship famous boyfriends paparazzi geography and the uneasy way celebrities interact with laypeople <>
{1} the romantic side of notting hill works most effectively because curtis and director roger michell persuasion allow it to develop in stages <>
initially anna and williams attraction to one other is abstract <>
anna is intrigued that william treats her with a degree of normalcy and longs for the simpler life she sees in williams interaction with his group of friends william previously unlucky in love is overwhelmed by the prospect of being desired by one of the worlds most desirable women <>
the abstractions give way to a more personal understanding during a day spent together which in turn give way to more concrete realization of the different worlds in which they live <>
crackling with chemistry together both stars give assured engaging performances <>
while still leaving a few rough edges annas prickly preoccupation with the perils of her fame williams addiction to the love heroin of his romance with a star <>
{2} its convenient that the writer who can put these romantic developments together is also one of the finest comedy writers working <>
curtis a cocreator of both the wonderfully wordy blackadder and the purely physical mr bean has always had an impressive comic range <>
here he slides from the broad rhys ifans as williams slovenly flatmate spike to the silly williams fumbling efforts to climb into a fenced private garden to the cleverly satirical a film press junket william muddles through posing as a reporter from horse and hound magazine with equal dexterity <>
the solid supporting cast including tim mcinnerny hugh bonneville and emma chambers comes through with appealing work but its curtis wicked way with a line or a visual gag that keeps the comic energy high <>
{1} notting hill does make the mistake of clocking in at a heavy minutes dragging out its denouement to an unnecessarily tortuous degree <>
in fact there are several occasions where the editing seems disjointed with odd cutaways and dialogue beginning too early <>
the technical glitches are perhaps more notable in a film which spins its romance unabashedly into a confection thats pure hollywood and not just because one of the characters is a hollywood star <>
this is romantic comedy in an oldfashioned sense where the pleasures come more from a zestful staging than from foolish details like whether the relationship is realistic <>
notting hill takes you to a slightly heightened reality a place where movie magic moves you because it has found both the romance and the comedy in romantic comedy <>

{0} is the loss of sexual innocence mike figgis experimental nonlinear tone poem pretentious <>
of course it is youve got to have a healthy streak of pretentiousness in you to break free from conventional narrative structure and make something so distinct that its occasionally confounding <>
perhaps a better question is whether the loss of sexual innocence is nothing but pretentious <>
even more so than in most films the answer to that question will be an eyeofthebeholder proposition <>
some will see little more than insufferable gratuitous iconoclastic noodling <>
others will see a film that grips you with many of its images even as it keeps you at an artistic arms length <>
{0} though there is no structured story to the loss of sexual innocence there is a focal point in the character of nic seen at various formative stages of his life <>
as an adolescent jonathan rhysmeyers he has his first fumbling sexual experiences as an adult julian sands he struggles with a marriage to a wife kelly macdonald as full of doubts as he is <>
much of the film deals with nics work as an ethnographic filmmaker working with a crew in a remote african location while another subplot spins us off into the world of twins saffron burrows separated at birth <>
and serving as a bridge between all these episodes is an impressionistic rendering of the eden story following the experiences of adam femi ogumbanjo and eve hanne klintoe <>
{2} what may appear from that description to be a fragmented film actually feels surprisingly cohesive <>
figgis maintains a consistent tone for his various images creating a collection of cinematic short stories as thematically connected as hemingways a moveable feast <>
the piano music of schumann and chopin trades places with figgis own compositions accentuating some magical cinematography by benoit delhomme <>
if you allow yourself to get lost in the loss of sexual innocence and avoid succumbing to the temptation to figure out what everything means it can wash over your resistance to its unconventionality <>
some of the individual stories like a chance meeting between the twins pack an emotional wallop <>
some of the individual visions like a golden landscape that dissolves into the ripples of a water reflection are breathtakingly unforgettable <>
{-1} and to be frank some of it is just plain weird <>
in one sequence we are shown the dreams of nic and his wife <>
instead of giving us a view of an inner life the scenes play out like a parody of dream images full of dissonant music and shifting realities like a yearstoolate outtake from twin peaks <>
most baffling and annoying to some will be the garden of eden sequences which conspicuously match a transluscently nordic eve with a strikingly black adam both of whom are fully nude in every scene <>
theres nothing particularly revelatory about figgis account of the fall but his interracial first parents nothing visually compelling in his unblinking staredown with innocence personified <>
by the time the tale closes with an absurd vision of paparazzi chasing the nowfallen pair outside the gates of paradise it all starts to look more like a calvin klein ad than a cinematic experiment <>
{0} thats the level on which the loss of sexual innocence is bound to set to itching those who cant stand it when their art looks this inyourface arty <>
there are times when figgis efforts grow wearying in their lack of basic resonance with the viewers experiences <>
there are also times when he hits the nail spectacularly on the head and times when the film works on an almost symphonic level <>
mike figgis wants to use the cinema the way only cinema can be used and without question he does so <>
the extent to which this mixed bag of mourning and memory succeeds is a matter for extremely subjective analysis <>

[18538/3]
{-2} it would be easier and kinder to think of the thirteenth floor as a simple case of bad timing <>
after all this is the fourth film in three months in which characters begin to doubt the nature of their reality following the matrix existenz and open your eyes <>
that much headtripping could be wearying under the best of circumstances and the thirteenth floor is far from the best of circumstances <>
this is genre filmmaking at its most superficially plotdriven compounding its shallow characterizations with a ridiculous degree of selfimportance <>
{0} the story opens with the murder of hannon fuller armin muellerstahl a software engineer who has created a fully functional simulated computer world modeled after los angeles complete with digital characters possessing a sense of self <>
one prime suspect is fullers partner douglas hall craig bierko who stands to profit most from fullers death and cant remember where he was at the time of the murderor how bloody clothing ended up in his laundry <>
when he learns that fuller left a message for him inside the simulation hall jacks in to the life of one of the simulation characters and discovers that another one of the characters vincent donfrio has learned that his world isnt real <>
as hall continues to investigate he begins to suspect that there is more to his own reality than meets the eye <>
{-2} theres nothing remarkably innovative about the films premise at this point but directorcowriter josef rusnak cant be faulted for bringing up the rear of the virtual reality parade <>
he can certainly be faulted however for the way he approached that premise <>
the thirteenth floor apparently wants halls existential crisis to matter yet the film never gives us enough background to understand hall his friendship with fuller or any of his anxieties <>
it often appears that key scenes of character development have been edited out and replaced by expository dialogue leaving little but essential plotadvancing events and craig bierkos deadeyed performance <>
that makes it virtually impossible for the story to develop any depth or for halls romance with a mysterious woman gretchen mol to be anything but functional <>
when the films real villain shows up for the first time with about minutes left its obvious that rusnaks primary goal is moving the story character development be hanged <>
{-1} a sciencefiction thriller can work of course without much profound commentary on the human condition heaven knows the matrix wasnt out to score philosophical brownie points <>
the matrix also didnt make the mistake of pretending to be anything more than it was treating its subject matter with a playful giddy energy <>
the thirteenth floor is one of those bleak somber exercises in which the gloom is meant to suggest significance but instead makes it even more impossible to enjoy the story <>
on only one occasion involving the confusion of fullers simulation counterpart does the thirteenth floor aspire to some kind of understanding <>
most of the time its a plodding bore grinding through the plot as though its themes were medicinally good for you instead of the stuff of paperback novels <>
{-2} i suppose its praiseworthy that the thirteenth floor does work at providing clues for its plot twists instead of dropping them in your lap <>
muellerstahl and donofrio are solid in their dual roles almost making up for the blank attractiveness of mol and bierko <>
the film certainly achieves the atmosphere its aiming for <>
unfortunately that atmosphere provides neither entertainment nor insight <>
even if youre prepared to overlook the inevitable headscratching convolutions of plot youre not likely to care about where theyre taking you <>
i can imagine an alternate reality in which filmmakers have figured out theres nothing more to say about alternate realities at least for the time being <>
it must be a better place than this <>

[18499/4]
{-1} there are few central dramatic conflicts trickier to pull off or more potentially annoying than a midlife crisis <>
the protagonist can easyily become unsympathetic his introspection little more than selfindulgence <>
its rare to find a character with the potential to turn a family mans grassisalwaysgreener musings into something compelling but thats exactly what we find in chris lloyd christian bale the central figure in metroland <>
what a shame that potential isnt remotely realized <>
metroland is a character study with huge chunks of context missing a surfacelevel gloss on the clash between youthful idealism and adult responsibility <>
{0} the story opens in where advertising man chris is living with his wife marion emily watson and infant daughter in the london suburb of eastwood a bedroom community dubbed metroland for its dependence on rail commuters <>
chris feels a vague discontent with his domestic life a discontent that becomes more palpable with a visit from his childhood friend toni lee ross <>
an itinerant wouldbe writer still living free and easy toni inspires chris to reflect on the path that led to his own domesticity <>
in flashback we see chris first as a rebellious teen in then as an aspiring photographer living in paris five years later <>
there he has a sexual affair with a french woman named annick elsa zylberstein an affair that haunts him with thoughts of a life that might have been <>
{1} plenty of things about chris are intriguing conceptually <>
as a youth and again as an adult he is convinced by toni that life in this bourgeois world is pathetic a shabby substitute for a life of art and random affairs <>
what chris finds hard to accept is that metroland is actually the world he prefers <>
he drifts from annick to marion because he feels disconnected from the life he craves then he drifts from marion because he thinks he has sold out the bold dreams of his youth even though he was never entirely committed to them <>
as midlife crisis material goes this is pretty unique stuff a man who strays not so much because hes unhappy with what he has but because he figures hes supposed to be unhappy <>
{-2} dont make the mistake of assuming director philip saville and screenwriter adrian hodges will flesh out those ideas <>
for all its flashing back metroland never portrays chris interacting with his family as a youth to provide background for his feelings about suburbia <>
it never spends enough time developing the friendship with toni that will color chris entire life <>
it never explores tonis character in any depth relying on thirdparty psychoanalysis to explain his motivations <>
theres a consistent superficiality to metroland a refusal to give the characters a depth that makes plot developments like a late revelation regarding marion feel anything but arbitrary and exploitative <>
{-1} theres some nice atmosphere to metroland particularly from mark knopflers silky score and an effective period look <>
but it doesnt come close to making up for the narrative shortcomings <>
it doesnt help that seville uses inefficient techniques like crosscutting with chris pondering face throughout the flashbacks <>

{-2} to your list of absolute cinematic oxymorons you know like pauly shore comedy or keanu reeves performance please add the following bittersweet farce <>
thats the disastrous combination served up by the love letter a film that fairly screams for a more frivolous treatment <>
the basic setup is pure farce with bookstore proprietor and recent divorcee helen macfarquahar kate capshaw of picturesque loblolly by the sea massachusetts discovering a beautifully poetic love letter between the cushions of a couch in her shop <>
both the the writer and the addressee are anonymous leading helen to wonder if it might be for her <>
her suspicions become stronger when her young summer employee johnny tom everett scott begins flirting with her little realizing that johnny has spotted the letter and believes in turn that it is from helen to him <>
{-1} thus begins a tale which initially appears headed towards a wild sequence of misunderstandings as helens coworker janet ellen degeneres also spies the letter and suspects it to be to her from hunky fireman george tom selleck <>
that might have been a clever breezy entertainment something considerably less labored than the mess delivered by screenwriter maria maggenti from cathleen schines novel and director peter hosun chan <>
their tale is intended i suppose to be a touching tale of a middleaged woman trying to rediscover romance a sensitively portrayed maydecember relationship mixed with the starcrossed interactions of helen and high school classmate george who it turns out has carried a torch from afar for lo these twenty years <>
we should understand the way the letter affects helen the way it closes one door in her life and opens her up to the opportunities she has missed and the opportunities still to come <>
{-2} if maggenti and chan had offered some characters remotely resembling threedimensional people it might even have worked <>
the love letter makes no effort whatsoever to explain johnnys interest in helen spends about thirty seconds establishing janet as little more than comic relief before creating a blinkandyoullmissit subplot regarding her jealousy of helen and wraps up with an outofleftfield relationship between two characters about whom we know virtually nothing <>
key relationships like that between helen and her absentee mother played by blythe danner materialize out of thin air and supporting characters like helens grandmother played by titanics gloria stuart serve no purpose <>
even capshaws helen the films center is an enigma <>
for a film that apparently wants you to care who ends up with whom the love letter gives you none of the tools to do so <>
its a whodunnit with no clues <>
{-2} somehow in the middle of this clumsy confection one genuinely interesting character appears <>
as jennifer another employee of helens who dotes on unrequitedly on johnny julianne nicholson is wonderfully sweet and achingly selfconscious <>
masking her insecurities behind her college course sociological analysis she makes for a great character in a story of how romantic happiness can be thwarted both from without and within <>
the troublie is shes the only character in the film who belongs in such a story <>
everyone else plays the kind of functional cardboard role youd expect to find in <>
well a farce about a love letter of unknown authorship changing hands indiscriminately <>
theres not a solid laugh to be found in this pretty to look at but illconceived romantic comedy except at the idea that someone thought a bittersweet farce could work <>

{-1} perhaps its an indication of how far we have come but gay comingofage films are becoming as formulabound and potentially trite as straight comingofage films <>
confused younger protagonist experienced older object of desire confrontations with friends andor family who just dont understandwe have been there and we have done that <>
to paraphrase my colleague mike dangelo we have to ask ourselves whether we would care about the people or the situation if the central romantic entaglements were heterosexual and often the answer is no <>
gay or straight i was never the same after that summer films often go nowhere new or interesting <>
{0} edge of seventeen does try to take us somewhere new exploring an angle most gaythemed films only view as an afterthought how friends and family respond to a startling comingout <>
writer todd stephens semiautobiographical story centers on eric hunter chris stafford approaching his senior year of high school in sandusky ohio circa with only the typical yearold concerns working a summer job here at a lakeside amusement park figuring out college plans deciding which skinny tie goes with his dyed hair and hanging out with his best female friend maggie tina holmes <>
then an amusement park coworker named rod andersen gabrych catches erics eye in an unexpected way turning his simple middle american life upsidedown <>
{1} in some ways edge of seventeen is quite a conventional independent film examining gay subject matter <>
the narrative eventually spends a lot of time in sanduskys only gay bar as eric begins hanging out with the friends of his lesbian amusement park supervisor comic lea delaria with the predictable exchanges of catty barbs ensuing <>
fortunately even those scenes are sparked by the unaffected appealing work of stafford in the lead role <>
his goofy innocence and teenjim carrey grin generate surprising sympathy in erics predicament as he begins exploring his sexuality in secret <>
the technical credits may be predictably shaky and the supporting performances uneven gabrych is somewhat wooden as erics first love but edge of seventeen manages to hold some interest in its story even when its not revolutionaryand it is amusing to hear the bronski beat again <>
{0} the really good news in edge of seventeen also turns out ultimately to be the bad news <>
the films best two best performances emerge when stafford and director david moreton begin to address the confusion of those who dont know how to react when a loved one announces that hes gay <>
stephanie mcvay has one marvelous scene as erics mother trying to reconcile her feelings about gay people with the notion that her son is one <>
even better is tina holmes as maggie whose tries to support eric even as she deals with her own unrequited crush on him <>
as sensitively as the filmmakers handle erics various experimentations none of them bear quite the emotional impact of the responses of these two women to erics sexual orientation <>
{0} in general edge of seventeen feels neither revelatory nor redundant merely unfolding with a simple honesty that makes it feel blandly familiar <>
the strength of two young performers particularly holmes an actress to watch for elevates the film a bit above its likethemed kin but not as much as a different focus might have done <>
perhaps stephens was too close to the experience of his own comingout to recognize that the strength of his story was on the periphery <>
if he had run with that unique angle he might have been on to a really good film instead of a slightlyaboveaverage story of how someone was never the same after that summer <>

[18146/4]
{-1} i am reminded of a favorite line from the coen brothers film barton fink in this era of the wildly overproduced blockbuster <>
barton fink an intellectual writer who has come to hollywood in the early s reports to his studio boss that hes having trouble getting started on his first assignment a wrestling film starring wallace beery <>
the baffled mogul responds wallace beery wrestling picturewhat do you need a road map <>
when it comes to genre filmmaking theres an easy way to get the audience to respond the way you want them to respond and theres the way writerdirector stephen sommers chooses to craft his remake of the mummy <>
rarely has a film exterted so much narrative effort to say so little <>
{0} that narrative begins in bc where the egyptian high priest imhotep arnold vosloo after an affair with the pharaohs mistress is buried alive to carry a curse on the world should he ever be awakened <>
flash forward to where soldier of fortune nick oconnell brendan fraser discovers the lost city of hamunaptra legendary site of untold treasure and unbeknownst to anyone imhoteps tomb <>
flash forward again three years where egyptologistlibrarian evelyn rachel weisz and her neerdowell brother jonathan john hannah learn that the jailed oconnell knows the location of hamunaptra and win his freedom in exchange for his aid <>
thus begins a journey to the lost city which results in the release of imhotep who emerges into the th century with a mission an attitude and a whole lot of nasty supernatural powers <>
{1} unlike the original this version is more actionadventure than horror focusing on derringdo over scaringdo <>
it certainly delivers its share of fight sequences some of them are even fairly rousing combining unique visual effects with narrow escapes and a dose of visual humor <>
the echoes of raiders of the lost ark are obvious but the mummy may actually owe an equal debt to sam raimis army of darkness in its attempts at supernatural slapstick <>
though nowhere near the level of the indiana jones films and indeed not even necessarily at the level of army of darkness the mummy at times manages to deliver the goods <>
{-2} the goals of a film like the mummy should be fairly simple yet sommers manages to miss the point entirely over and over again <>
the plot summary above doesnt do remote justice to the sacks of exposition extraneous plot threads and gonowhere characters with which the mummy is burdened <>
the film takes forever to set up the premise with the exploration party finally reaching hamunaptra at about the one hour mark <>
unnecessary complications ensue with the inclusion of a rival team of explorers guided by a sniveling former colleague of oconnells kevin j oconnor increasing the body count in the least efficient manner possible <>
the danger to evelyn targeted by imhotep as part of his plan to resurrect his former love is buried beneath the ten plagues of egypt which imhotep conveniently controls to allow for some more cool special effects <>
theres no economy to the mummy no understanding of how to create a solid hero a solid villain and a solid conflict and let the action roll <>
{-2} it would be easy enough to snipe at the dopey dialogue and silly performances in the mummy im still waiting for someone to convince me that brendan fraser has leadingman charm especially since it would deserve every snipe <>
there are a few clever touches <>
but mostly sommers seems to show the typical blockbuster disdain for characters and situations which do anything more than set up the next effects shot <>
yet such complaints miss the point that the mummy isnt even a good brainless action film with its lumbering pacing <>
all the jawdropping visual trickery in the world doesnt help if a film wanders around in circles before pulling out its a material <>
groan if you must but the mummy needed to be wrapped up much more tightly <>
the mummy horror picturewhat do you need a road map <>

[18096/8]
{1} this is how i know im dealing with a film of uncommon intelligence election resists the tidy summations in which most films are alltooeager to wrap themselves <>
like many recent films it is a comedy set in a high school but its more than just the latest high school comedy <>
it deals with a student body election but its not really about a student body election <>
its a film in which characters narrate much of the story but it doesnt use that narration in a conventional way <>
like director alexander paynes previous film citizen ruth if to a somewhat less successful degree election is a satirical scalpel that refuses to let you know exactly when or whom its going to cut <>
{0} its spring at omaha nebraskas carver high school as election begins which means its time for elections for the next years student body officers <>
the prime candidate and apparently only candidate for student body president is tracy flick reese witherspoon an extracurricular machine who sees the office as her destiny <>
seeing things a bit differently is jim mcallister matthew broderick a civics teacher and student government advisor that tracy rubs the wrong way <>
in an attempt to make the election less of a foregone conclusion mcallister convinces injured football hero paul metzler chris klein to mount a challenge which in turn generates the third party candidacy of pauls alienated younger sister tammy <>
{2} it would have been easy enough for election to turn into a broad comedy about adolescent peer politics and it still would have been more insightful than most teen comedies <>
payne and cowriter jim taylor working from tom perrottas novel have bigger targets in mind <>
they use the carver high election as a microcosm not just of high school life but of politics on a much grander scale <>
tracy flicks campaign casts her as a political cousin of our current president seeking election as a you really like me validation rathern than out of a desire to serve even her nomination speech parrots the namingofnames ifeelyourpain personal touch <>
tammy meanwhile rallies the disenfranchised minority behind the idea that nothing changes but the names in conventional governance <>
even the ridiculous posters filled with little more than sloganeering seem disturbingly similar to national election campaigning <>
its savvy cynical and very funny <>
{2} even more effective is paynes use of that old literary device the unreliable narrator as counterpoint to his direction <>
mcallister tracy paul and tammy take turns explaining their take on the events of the film each one mouthing words that dont quite match their his or her actions <>
mcallister describes his personal and professional contentment as he sifts through a trunk full of pornography <>
sexuallyconfused tammy explains that im not a lesbian im attracted to the person its just that all the people ive been attracted to have been girls <>
tracy describes her mothers actions on her behalf in a way that shows shes being programmed for greatness <>
only paul perhaps too dense to be duplicitous seems pure of heart <>
as he did in citizen ruth payne explores the way we convince ourselves that our motivations are pure even when we dont really understand what our motivations are <>
{1} if payne stumbles anywhere its in his choice to focus much of the films second half on mcallisters domestic troubles <>
tammys character in particular is abandoned by this choice letting the school administrations reaction to her unconventional candidacy off the hook too easily <>
but election is too smart to be derailed by this problem too cleareyed in its study of good intentions muddled by psychological baggage <>
with surprising sympathy towards all his flawed characters alexander payne creates a furiously funny film in which his surrealistic directing touches keep the audience offguard <>
he understands that in a world where people cant even summarize themselves in a neatandtidy sentence we cant expect to summarize the movies about them that way <>

[18020/3]
{-1} at least entrapment lets you know what your in for from its opening shot a sweeping helicopter approach over water towards the new york skyline <>
its a shot that has opened many a recent film one of those showy moodsetters of which imaginationimpaired directors are so very fond <>
of course you cant expect much more from a director when hes working with imaginationimpaired writers <>
there are movies that repulse you movies that enthrall you and then there are movies that just plug away joylessly to fill a genre slot on a release schedule entrapment is one of those movies apparently made by people who have spent their entire lives locked away from the world watching other moviesand not even other good movies <>
{0} the setup finds an insurance investigator named virginia gin baker catherine zetajones fascinated with the career of a legendary art thief named robert mac macdougal sean connery <>
mac has cost gins company millions so gin convinces her boss will patton to let her launch a plan to reel him in <>
posing as a thief herself gin lures mac into a partnership to steal a priceless chinese mask <>
the alliance is of course an uneasey one complicated by the distrust of macs partner and supplier thibadeaux ving rhames and the romantic feelings developing between the two duplicitous characters <>
{-2} its possible that entrapment could have gotten away with being just a heist thriller the elaborately choreographed breakins are decently crafted and offer at least an occasional whiff of tension <>
unfortunately the script credited to ron bass and william broyles but actually the work of several more wants to cast gin and mac as starcrossed lovers kindred spirits divided by their hidden agendas <>
its a thoroughly failed attempt since the characters are kept so enigmatic that its never possible to understand their attraction and their exchanges are so leaden that they might as well have the pages of the script on the table in front of them <>
meanwhile the pacing grows so lugubrious as gin and mac exchange loaded glances that youre likely to nod off between breakin set pieces <>
{-2} the other option for a viewer is to use that time to play spot the cliche <>
be sure to have your pad and pen ready from that opening helicopter shot because entrapment appears to be the product of a scriptomatic <>
from the bfollowsa dialogue exchanges she there wont be any surprises he there always are surprises to the physicsdefying disappearing acts from the ominous locationidentifying onscreen titles to the training montage the film is on autopilot from start to finish <>
thank heaven for ving rhames vaguely menacing performance and maury chaykins bizarre sidney greenstreetmeetstruman capote crime boss or there might not have been a second of entrapment worth remembering a day later <>
its designed to be swallowed without chewing <>
{-2} i suppose thats partially to avoid giving anyone in the audience reason to ponder the jawdropping gaps in logic <>
entrapment ends with one of those betcha didnt see that coming conclusions which frankly i didnt see coming <>
id also long ago given up caring especially when the behavior of the characters at certain points in the film makes no sense whatsoever when compared to what we eventually learn about them <>
you can only forgive that kind of lazinessdisguisedascleverness if a film has been working hard to entertain you to keep you engaged from start to finish entrapment is a film that just doesnt care <>
its a film about theft all rightof your money your time and the devices of a dozen other trite hollywood star projects <>

[18008/1]
{-2} i dont think theres a time idle hands could have been released that would have made it a good film but its unfortunate release at this particular time makes it seem even more rancid <>
in the wake of the april st shootings at littleton colorados columbine high school pundits and politicians have been holding forth on the desensitizing effects of violence in our popular culture particularly that which is aimed at teenagers <>
the hardcore first amendment advocate in me has approached most of this talk as conservative rabble rousing but theres no defending something as brutally wrongheaded as idle hands <>
if this is what contemporary adolescents want to see in the movies we really are in trouble <>
{0} the plot such as it is centers on a yearold named anton tobias devon sawa whose lifes goal is to lay around watching t v and getting stoned with his buddies mick seth green and pnub elden henson <>
unfortunately for anton the devil will find work for idle hands to do as a malevolent spirit takes possession of his right hand and forces him to kill his parents mick and pnub <>
then mick and pnub return from the dead to provide wacky comic relief convincing a freakedout anton that extreme measures are required <>
that involves removing the offending appendage leaving five demonic digits free to wreak havoc at antons high school halloween dance <>
{-2} even on its most basic level idle hands is either idiotic or pandering when it isnt both <>
vivica a fox appears as a druid priestess following the handpossessing spirits trail of mayhem perhaps as some sort of misguided spoof of buffy the vampire slayer <>
the nubile lead actress jessica alba falls instantly for the slackerly anton naturally even finding his wayward hand kinky <>
naked breasts appear because well thats what naked breasts do in teenoriented films <>
the problemsolving powers of marijuana are lauded to the heavens <>
mick and pnub are the only two victims of antons to return from the grave even the internal logic of the films supernatural universe is fuzzy only to invite comparisons to another horror comedy john landis an american werewolf in london <>
and the gore it raineth down like waters from the heavens <>
only seth green with his wry delivery offers a moments entertainment amidst the stupidity <>
{-1} ill head off the rebuttals of the dude relax its just a movie contingent at the proverbial pass yes its supposed to be a horror comedy with its absurd excesses probably intentional to a certain extent <>
the problem is that the horror and the comedy are not combined with a knowing wink but sequenced in a disconcerting fashion <>
first someone is killed in a horrific manner then someone makes a joke about the murder <>
the numbing nonchalance of the commentary lends credence to the harshest condemnations of media violence in this film the ridicule isnt directed at the conventions of horror films but at the deaths of teenagers <>
when characters in the film gather at a makeshift memorial to two of antons victims its hard to suppress a shudder when images of columbine high school are still so fresh in our minds <>
{-2} of course its a freakish coincidence that idle hands appears as it does in the wake of that tragedy and that any of the films images bring it to mind <>
its harder to ignore turning straightforward carnage into comedy <>
im not sure whether idle hands could have redeemed itself if it actually had made a statement about the potential destructiveness of its protagonists lives of sloth instead of celebrating same but at least that would have been a nod to something beyond its audiences most antisocial tendencies <>
this film is a bad idea at an even worse time little more than fuel for the fires of righteous indignation which unfortunately are seeming a bit more righteous all the time <>

[17991/6]
{-1} film stories of improbable obsession are always tricky because theyre sowell so improbable <>
in a novel its easier to delve into tangled psychology through interior monologue or prose to understand for instance why a middleaged man destroys his life for a teenager called lolita <>
there is also the secondary problem of giving a face to the object of desire creating the possibility that the obsession just wont make any sense <>
a film about irrational passions has to immerse a viewer in that irrationality even as it gives you some small sense that the irrationality is based on something understandable <>
{0} benoit jacqots the school of flesh lecole de la chair struggles in both respects <>
its the story of dominique isabelle huppert an unmarried paris fashion executive at a point in her life when her career is the focus of her life <>
that changes one night when she spies a bartender named quentin vincent martinez at a local nightspot and becomes fascinated with him <>
though quentins transvestite coworker chris vincent lindon warns dominique that quentin is a hustler indiscriminate of gender dominique still invites him to dinner and eventually to bed <>
soon dominique has made quentin a kept man sharing her apartment and money with him even though he continues to lead his previous life <>
their relationship twists and turns into something neither one can quite identify though both need it desperately <>
{-1} exactly why they need it is not entirely clear <>
the script based on a novel by japanese author yukio mishima the sailor who fell from grace with the sea does a decent job of painting quentin as a troubled man who uses his body for his personal gain then shows disdain for anyone who wants him for that body <>
dominique is a more perplexing case <>
isabelle huppert effectively conveys a confident woman slowly becoming a paranoid mess following quentin on his rounds through the city <>
jacquots direction however keeps us too distanced from dominiques obsession for it to make sense as anything more profound than a middleaged fling <>
though the narrative toys with the provocative notion that the childless dominique is acting out a maternal fantasy as much as a sexual one the script is too timid to attack that subtext <>
the school of fleshs academic detachment makes it difficult to feel her pain whatever it might be <>
{-1} its even more difficult to understand why vincent martinez is the man who turns her world upside down <>
the school of flesh is not the first film to assert an unlikely mans attractiveness to women the entire woody allen oeuvre comes to mind but that doesnt make it any easier to accept this particular example <>
though martinez certainly isnt ugly its unlikely hed be anyones paradigm of masculine beauty he most closely resembles a slightly more swarthy joaquin phoenix <>
still everyone in the film is smitten with quentin dominique chris a distinguised attorney francois berleand an impressionable teenage girl roxane mesquida <>
quentins animal magnetism is central to the school of fleshs premise yet i didnt notice enough magnetism to erase a computer disk <>
{-1} the school of flesh still manages to be somewhat engaging simply because the relationship dynamics are effectively portrayed <>
its rather touching watching quentin try to make dominique admit shed discard him if he were ugly <>
its amusing watching dominique struggle to balance her desire for quentin with her embarrassment to be with him in public settings <>
both central characters are intriguing enough to follow <>
but its hard to watch them both degrade themselves when its not clear enough why theyre doing it <>
obsession makes for great drama if the why is as important as the what the school of flesh leaves you wondering why <>
as well as why him <>

{0} goodbye lover is the kind of nihilistic entertainment that gives you a few giggles while watching it then leaves you feeling dirty for not loathing the whole enterprise <>
aptly labeled a filmgris in the production notes its a convoluted comic thriller centered around sandra dunmore patricia arquette a real estate agent with dreams of the good life and a car full of motivational tapes reminding her that she can have it <>
standing in her way unfortunately is her alcoholic husband jake dermot mulroney which leads her to an affair with jakes more successful brother ben don johnson while ben also romances a coworker named peggy marylouise parker on the side <>
when the tangled interactions of this quartet leads to murder det rita pompano ellen degeneres comes on the scene to investigate and discovers that very little is what it appears to be <>
{-1} the reason nothing is what it appears to be is that goodbye lover is a film about twistyturny plottingand essentially thats all its about <>
allegiances shift backs are stabbed figuratively and literally and greed is the order of the day <>
its the kind of stuff that usually makes a film interesting to watch thanks to its unpredictability but goodbye lover becomes strangely predictable in its unpredictability <>
its so instantly obvious that its a film about hidden agendas that it becomes a matter of waiting until the next characters obviously hidden agenda is revealed <>
theres not much fun in the zigs and zags the story takes because every minutes or so you know its going to be time for the next zig or zag and the next permutation in a series of unholy alliances <>
{1} theres still something overthetop goofy about goodbye lover which makes it possible to slip into its sociopathic world <>
patricia arquette is an ideal cast as sandra a driven barbie doll who sees herself as the cutthroat reincarnation of julie andrews maria from the sound of music <>
the performance is only soso but the character is such a wild blend of madonna and whore that shes enjoyable to watch <>
ellen degeneres gets most of the prime punch lines as the embittered det pompano most directed at her morally upright mormon partner ray mckinnon <>
the real key to appreciating goodbye lover however is slipping into the slickness of a production which takes the image of los angeles as duplicity capital of the world and blows it up to billboard size <>
from the encounters with spindoctoring publicists to the ubiquitous use of mirrors goodbye lover has a blast with tartedup sleaze and the way motivated misanthropes can create an image that allows them get away with murder literally and figuratively <>
{0} in fact goodbye lover is so gleeful in its complete absence of humanity that it may take you a while after its over <>
before you feel the need to shower its decadence right off of yourself <>
its too selfaware of its lack of real characters to inspire too much headwagging but its still one of those films that finds it cool to set up the only person with an ounce of optimism as an object of ridicule <>
goodbye lover is full of uglyontheinside types who feel justified doing whatever it takes to grab the golden ring because after all everyone else is doing it <>
theres just enough residual cheesiness to keep the film in the realm of the surreal with just enough bleak attitude to blunt its surreal appeal <>
its not a thriller so much as it is an ultrablack comedy where part of the joke is on you for leaving your moral outrage at the door <>

{-1} james merendinos slc punk has something deep and insightful to say about the nature of youthful rebellion sort of maybe i think <>
its sort of hard to tell through all the bombast of merendinos hyperactive period piece which tries to be a sort of nostalgic breakfast club for the dead kennedys set but misses the point entirely <>
its one thing to make a film about teens grousing over the sellouts of adulthood and the trials of coping with societal expectations and target it at the teens themselves its quite another to make such a film and target it at those whove already been through that melodramatic wringer <>
the simple enjoyment that might have come from the time and the tunes instead turns into a minute wait for the characters to get a clue <>
{0} our tour guide through slc punk is stevo matthew lillard who along with his best friend heroin bob michael goorjian is one of the few true punks in the capital of conservative utah during the conservative reagan era circa <>
the tour consists largely of an anthropological dig through stevo and bobs twisted clique which includes an independently wealthy and extremely paranoid drug dealer til schweiger the lads respective ladyfriends jennifer lien and annabeth gish and an acid casualty devon sawa <>
along the way we learn about the various subcategories of salt lake city youth the influence of stevos s radicalturnedyuppie father christopher mcdonald and where to go for real beer when you need it <>
{-2} like many an independent comedy slc punk has enough frantic energy to guarantee at least a few belly laughs notably during stevos spin through a party describing the various subplots in action and a scene showing our protagonists as prepunk dungeons and dragonsobsessed middleschoolers <>
also like many an independent comedy it often has nothing but frantic energy <>
for every decent gag or clever insight you can count on at least two or three selfindulgent uses of direct address to the camera in which stevo rails about religious oppression or the plague of poseurs ie those who son the garb without walking the walk <>
scenes which im assuming should come off as either amusing or wisebeyondhisyears instead come off as merely damp <>
if spittle were diamonds matthew lillards performance would surely be a piece of comic jewelry fit for a princess <>
once again a filmmakers attempt to connect with the audience through narration becomes a lazy failure <>
{-2} slc punk tries to score its major profundity points when stevo is hit by the bombshell that rebellious youth are just conformists of a different kind <>
well you can file that one under d for duh stevos revelation is one with which any audience member over the age of will already be quite familiar <>
its that kind of pseudowisdom that makes slc punk far more tiresome than a film built around devotion to the ramones should have been <>
when tragedy strikes one of the films significant characters late in the film and merendino tries to play it as a genuine tragedy you realize he hasnt remotely earned an emotional response <>
slc punk blasts through its set pieces with little filmmaking prowess then expects to tie it all together by having stevo blubber away at misspent youth poseurs indeed <>

{1} in his last film s littleseen the gingerbread man robert altman took his unique perspective to the finer points of the legal systems workings in the american south <>
apparently he decided he hadnt yet explored it in all possible depth because hes back in dixie for cookies fortune <>
the regions easy rhythms and idiosyncracies seem to suit the filmmaker well and he seems to be having a heck of a good time with his visits there <>
cookies fortune finds altman laying down a blues jam of intertwining characters spiced with a deft dry comic touch into a surprising offbeat entertainment <>
{-2} the cookie of the title is eccentric matriarch jewel mae cookie orcutt patricia neal strongwilled inabitant of a holly springs mississippi manor with her black houseman willis charles s dutton <>
cookie is estranged from her only family in town nieces camille dixon glenn close and cora duvall julianne moore but that doesnt stop the overbearing camille from considering everything connected to her family her business <>
thats especially true when camille visits cookies home only to discover a scene which could potentially bring embarrassment to the family and contrives a story to cover it up <>
her story sets in motion a strange chain of events which finds innocent people jailed secrets revealed and plenty of wild turkey consumed <>
{-1} cookies fortune is probably most easily summarized as a southern spin on fargos tale of polite commonsense police investigation <>
but that doesnt entirely capture the films quirky rhythms <>
on the surface its the story of camilles manipulations of simpleminded cora of coras wildchild expatriate daughter emma liv tyler of everyone involved in the investigation at cookies estate providing glenn close with a grand showcase for a woman who turns her own life into a tennessee williams play <>
yet even as camilles plans begin to unravel cookies fortune is less about the suspense and tension of guilt exposed than it is about the pleasures of watching it meander to its inevitable conclusion <>
as it is in many altman films the plot wellconstructed as it is by anne rapp works best as a place for a handful of appealing performances to unfold <>
{1} and there are certainly plenty of appealing performances <>
of which closes is only the most gaudy <>
charles s dutton wraps himself around williss goodnatured roguery giving the character a wellworn charm <>
ned beatty similarly entertains as the police chief little concerned with bythebook procedure among friends <>
matt malloy has a funny minor role as an overzealous investigator <>
even chris odonnell so often an attractive blank hole as an actor acquits himself well in the ideal role of a puppydogeagertoplease deputy <>
the only stumble comes from julianne moore who doesnt know quite what to do with cora whether to make her a simple naif or an even sadder case of a woman with a genuine developmental disability <>
fortunately shes a rare false note in altmans smooth orchestration <>
{1} cookies fortune is the kind of unconventional narrative of lingering takes that may leave some viewers shifting in their seats waiting for the point of it all <>
for altman in this particular case taking the time to get to the point is actually part of the point <>
its a comedy of details dropped in almost offhandedly and others a hand literally caught in the cookie jar for instance underlined at just the right moment <>
it doesnt add up to all that much either as character study or as crime drama nor does it take the straightest path between any two points <>
its merely a lazy crazy consistently amusing diversion about a place where you only know the true measure of a man or a woman after youve gone fishing together <>
its a place altman might consider visiting more often <>

{-2} in this cinematic era aq after quentin much film criticism is filtered through the popculture sieve that is tarantino <>
we just cant seem to help ourselves when were not noting ways tarantino has cribbed from his filmmaking forebears were noting the ways his acolytes have cribbed from him <>
a gun cant be fired but his name is invoked a conversation cant be peppered with profanity and obscure references but he becomes an adjective <>
when a film like go appears so like pulp fiction in both narrative structure and style its easy to dismiss it on a comparative basis without discussing why the tarantino oeuvre has become the greenwich mean time for an entire genre the edgy afterhours comic thriller <>
its easy to miss why director doug limans film works in the ways it understands tarantinos unique touch <>
and doesnt work in the ways it fails to understand <>

simon meanwhile is on a road trip to las vegas with a trio of pals including marcus taye diggs a road trip which always seems to be just one step ahead of complete disaster <>
these three stories meet swerve and overlap through one wild hour period filled with sex drugs and a prechristmas rave <>
{1} theres something to be said for a film with the ability to grab you viscerally which is one of the tricks go manages to pull off <>
that description isnt just about pacing though go moves with the hypnotic momentum of a rave beat nor is it just about the level of violence and action though theres one kicker of a car chase through vegas <>
like the most memorable moments in pulp fiction the most memorable moments in go energize you with the sense that youre really not sure whats going to happen next <>
at key junctures you realize that screenwriter john august is in complete command of his narrative as he turns expectations upside down in ways that make perfect sense not just because he can <>
{1} thats not to say that go doesnt wander off on tangents just because they might prove to be entertaining <>
go isnt a clean linear story even in the most fundamental ways <>
but its also a case of a film that doesnt let the main storyline get in the way of some hilarious distractions <>
ronnas entrepreneurial spirit as she sells her own special brand of pills at the party zack and adam at a christmas dinner with ulterior motives simon experimenting with tantric sex with a pair of bridesmaids the encyclopedic knowledge of a cat during a hallucinogenic trip <>
like much of tarantinos work its a loose and sloppy sort of a film <>
which doesnt mean that theres no logic to whats going on <>
its just the logic of giving an audience one heck of a ride letting the characters stroll and stray because the filmmakers have created an atmosphere where we trust theyll stroll somewhere interesting <>
{1} unlike much of tarantinos work however theres not much going on beneath the glittering surface of go <>
the closest it gets to a thematic link is the idea that these young people dash into dangerous situations with little restraint on their desire towell to go <>
theres nothing resembling the moral center of pulp fiction nor do august and liman show nearly as much affection for their flawed selfabsorbed characters <>
the performances are solid <>
even when the chattery dialogue feels a bit forced <>
giving us plenty of reason to follow the characters even when they seem like hopeless screwups <>
but no one is experiencing a fundamental life change <>
go is a dazzling demonstration of how good even a derivative sort of film can be when someone grasps the basic principles of engrossing filmmaking <>
it also demonstrates what we talk about when we talk about tarantino a way of telling us something about humanity between the bursts of dialogue and gunfire <>

{-1} im willing to forgive never been kissed many of its failings because for all practical purposes its a fantasy <>
i can over look the irony of a film about an adult returning to interact with teenagers which portray teens the same inane way adults usually think of them <>
i can let it slide that the tone is terminally bubbly when a touch of venom might have helped <>
i can even shrug my shoulders at the notion that drew barrymore was ever a spatupon teen wretch <>
sometimes a romantic comedy can get away with being ridiculous as it strives to pull us into its wish fulfillment <>
what it cant get away with is being lazy or being miscast the two blunders that insure never been kissed never had a chance <>
{1} our highconcept premise finds yearold chicago suntimes copy editor josie geller barrymore offered her first real reporting assignment going undercover as a high school student <>
the assignment brings mixed emotions for josie a brainy high school outcast still smarting from her adolescent ostracism <>
as she begins her quest for a story josie finds herself drawn back into the world of the smart kids at south glen south high school including her new friend aldys leelee sobieski <>
thats before her editor john c reilly demands that josie get in with the in crowd and before josies arrested adolescent yearold brother rob david arquette also reenrolls and helps turn the onetime josie grossie into a potential prom queen <>
{-2} never been kissed does a serviceable job of telling josies story exploring how a woman comes to terms with the person she was and is <>
if only the script had shown as much dilligence with the other elements <>
arquettes character is potentially even more interesting than barrymores a jock who peaked at trying to relive his glory days but its generally watereddown and ignored <>
the romantic angle between josie and her english teacher michael vartan is halfheartedly developed muddles the entire point of the story are we supposed to believe that josie was incapable of finding true love before recreating her traumatic youth and builds to a spectacularly clumsy conclusion <>
most depressing of all is a ghastly device which finds josie wearing a miniature camera contributing nothing more to the story than pointless cutaways to josies coworkers gaping or cringing in embarrassment <>
{-2} theres plenty to gape and cringe at as barrymore plays josie <>
youve got to admire how gamely barrymore subjects herself to humiliating situations but shes all wrong for the lead role in her first feature as executive producer <>
even the marketing people at fox realize that shes most appealing as a sweet object of desire making the central image in the films publicity a photo of barrymore smiling coquettishly with knee drawn up to her chest <>
as a star carrying this film she looks out of her depth <>
its slightly embarrassing watching her play the professional josie as a tightlycoiffed fussbudget correcting everyones grammar and usage <>
as implausible as she may be as a high school senior she proves even more implausible as a grownup <>
{-2} you always want to like a film as goodnatured as never been kissed even though it wants so much to be liked <>
there simply isnt a nuance to the material that director raja gosnell manages to capture not a moment of sincere emotion nothing that doesnt look like it wouldnt exist if not for other movies about kids in high school <>
when the script manages to work in a wise observation like the idea that one popular person in high school can dictate whos cool and whos not it feels like someone tripped over it accidentally <>
never been kissed is most certainly a fantasy for anyone who ever felt like the quintessential high school outsider but the filmmakers are living in a fantasy world if they think thats all they need to deliver <>

{1} the outoftowners is the sort of film i generally greet with a generous helping of poohpoohing <>
its a remake of a neil simonpenned original which i have never seen its a vehicle to reunite two stars of a previous film steve martin and goldie hawn from s housesitter and its a broad farce cloaked in shallow sentimentality <>
the outoftowners often feels like its working awfully hard to extract its guffaws yet it still manages to extract its fair share <>
the comic energy of the three lead performers including the incomparable john cleese makes this silly trifle something moderately satisfying <>
{1} martin and hawn star as henry and nancy clark a columbus ohio couple facing a very empty nest <>
with their youngest son finally moved away the clarks are left alone to wonder whether theres any spark left in their lives together <>
a sparkigniter emerges unexpectedly when henry laid off from his advertising job but afraid to tell nancy heads to new york for a job interview with nancy as a lastminute companion <>
one rerouted plane mugging and eviction from a hotel by an officious manager cleese later the clarks find themselves hungry homeless and stranded in the big apple sharing their grandest adventure ever <>
{-1} it shouldnt be a surprise that the outoftowners feels derivative and not just because its a remake <>
nearly every element in the film is designed to have the comfort of the familiar from the pairing of the two stars to martins fuming in a planes trains automobiles scenario to hawns earnest ditziness to cleeses resurrection of basil fawlty and pythonesque crossdressing <>
while the script by marc lawrence writer of forces of nature who appears unusually fond of thwarted travel plans as an aphrodisiac pauses occasionally so henry and nancy can muse about the nature of their marriage its mostly concerned with setups for slapstick situations and tirades <>
{1} at times those situations and tirades feel forced you can practically see hawn and martin screaming to the audience for whoops and applause when they go on their respective rants against someone who gets their goat <>
at plenty of others the actors give the oldfashioned farce a kick it rarely gets on screen <>
martin and hawn share one classic hideinthebedroom scene with kids in the hall vet mark mckinney as a businessman nancy attempts to seduce for food and their chemistry even makes the personal moments feel somewhat genuine <>
even more wonderful is cleese a comic treasure too rarely seen <>
he may be able to do smiling misanthropes like his character here in his sleep but he still sends a charge through the outoftowners every moment hes on screen <>
cleeses scenes are reason alone for comedy fans to spend an hour and a half with this film <>
{-1} i do wish the outoftowners had shown more restraint with its characters subjecting them to a bit more frustration and a bit less abject humiliation <>
its not a subtle film by any stretch of the imagination <>
but there was enough humor to be found in the performers that we didnt need to see martin taking a hallucinogenic trip with his pants around his ankles <>
you may find a lot of the outoftowners familiar and foolish <>
you may also find yourself laughing at it in spite of yourself <>
theres something to be said for the way talented professionals can take predictable material and wring something fresh and funny from it <>

{2} a walk on the moon is a comingofage film which may lead you to expect the fetishizing of adolescent sexual experimentation <>
its set during s summer of love and at woodstock no less which may lead you to expect even more wonder yearsesque navelgazing than usual <>
there are some pleasant surprises in a walk on the moon actor tony goldwyns directing debut but the most pleasant may be that its mature <>
taking a unique perspective on that singularly revolutionizing american summer its a simple occasionally corny story with enough wisdom to realize that comingsofage dont happen exclusively to teenagers <>
{0} in this case it happens to pearl kantrowitz diane lane a married jewish mother of two living in new york city <>
the summer of finds the kantrowitzes taking the same vacation to the same catskills resort where they vacation every summer with pearls husband marty liev schreiber a television repairman commuting from the city on weekends <>
this summer seems certain to be something different however <>
pearls daughter alison anna paquin is about to become a woman and the resort is abuzz with the anticipation of the impending moon landing <>
most significantly pearl becomes attracted to the resorts itinerant blouse salesman walker jerome viggo mortensen and begins to wonder how she got so old so fast <>
{2} pearls story is a particularly interesting one to set during a time of social upheaval <>
obliged to surrender her youth when she got pregnant as a teenager pearl suddenly finds herself compelled to flirt with youthful irresponsibility when its a luxury she can no longer afford <>
surprisingly screenwriter pamela gray doesnt celebrate pearls affair with walker as the action of a woman finding herself nor does she turn marty nicely underplayed by schreiber into an easy scapegoat <>
a walk on the moon doesnt shy away from the selfabsorption of a wife and mother falling into the if it feels good do it ethos of the time embracing instead the idea of facing ones difficult choices <>
though gray occasionally turns her subtext into overly melodramatic text alison you had your chance to be the kid pearl no i didnt a walk on the moon generally lets diane lanes solid performance bring out pearls conflicts <>
{1} goldwyn also does a nice job of creating his s catskills milieu as a distinct amusing time and place <>
the camps neverseen public address voice an unbilled julie kavner makes ubiquitous announcements including the onset of alisons menstrual cycle women play mah jongg at outdoor card tables the men compare boastful tales of how quickly they managed to make the drive up from the city <>
the portrayals do occasionally drift into the stereotypical notably tovah feldshuh as martys predictably ironwilled oyspouting mother but the characters still maintain a sense of individuality even within their own world <>
when the throng of counterculture kids descends on this world for the generationdefining concertincluding a quick skinnydip in the camps private lakeit provides a wellrealized picture of the new freedom that calls to pearl <>
{-1} the only reason a walk on the moon feels awkward is that it fumbles the subplot involving alisons own adventures <>
gray and goldwyn clearly want alisons experimentation to parallel that of her mother but they dont dive into alisons character with nearly enough care <>
they take a halfhearted middle ground when one of the two extremes focusing entirely on pearl or making the two stories equally significant would have been genuinely effective <>
alisons flirtations and rebellion end up feeling token her relationship with her mother never fully explored <>
fortunately when a walk on the moon sticks with pearls growth including getting to know who her husband really is for the first time its an appealing character study <>
from its atmosphere to its acting its a nicely grownup story of growing up not just physically but emotionally <>

[17434/2]
{-2} an opening title in the mod squad conscientiously defines mod for the viewing audience then goes the extra mile of defining squad as well <>
its your first clue that the target audience is that ultradesirable and apparently lexicallychallenged youth demographic rather than primarily baby boomers familiar with the television series <>
not surprisingly the mod squad is a loud and generally stupid action film with a dose of teenangst melodrama <>
impressively it even compounds the misery with a ridiculously convoluted plot <>
{0} the basic setup like that of the series involves three troubled young people back in the day theyd be called juvenile delinquents recruited by lapd capt adam greer dennis farina to be a unique undercover trio <>
faced with the alternatives of prison or police work julie barnes claire danes pete cochran giovanni ribisi and linc hayes omar epps are assigned to get into places nobody else can <>
one of the places they still seem adapt at getting into is trouble trouble which gets particularly nasty when greer turns up dead and implicated in drug trafficking <>
for no really good reason other than a continuation of the film the mod squad begins its own investigation uncovering a conspiracy which would baffle xfiles creator chris carter <>
{-2} you might think that a dense multilayered plot would indicate faith in audience intelligence but youd be very mistaken indeed <>
the mod squad uses its innumerable narrative threads like shiny objects to distract an infant never really caring whether they make for a more interesting or engaging story <>
julie spends most of the film getting reinvolved with an old flame josh brolin while pete and linc track down leads in a plot line that runs mostly parallel <>
meanwhile pete has a sensitive moment with his estranged parents a goofy drug dealer michael lerner dances with linc to my favorite things <>
pete and julie almost kinda sorta get together and lincs car is the object of everwackier damage at petes hand <>
it doesnt even matter that many of the subplots drift together by the films conclusion its short attention span theater mentality makes it not at all worth the effort to keep up <>
{-2} its also a dimwitted and trite action film that has the nerve to wink ironically at its place in the pantheon of dimwitted and trite action films <>
pete given an offkilter sensibility by ribisi one of the few reasons to keep watching comments incredulously late in the film about dirty cops drug dealsi cant believe this actually happens i feel like i should be saying im getting too old for this sht <>
cute gag only the mod squad hasnt earned that level of selfdeprecation <>
its the kind of film where a guy spills his guts to someone who has chased him down yelling im a cop despite the absence of any badge or weapon <>
its the kind of film where the villains spell out their plans in more detail than james bond baddies <>
and its the kind of film that truly defines gratuitious sex violence and profanity <>
a bad movie cant be a commentary on the state of bad moviemaking <>
{-2} the strange thing is that much of that formulaic foolishness could have worked if the mod squad had been played straighter as an homage to formulaic earlys cop dramas <>
the only time the film is at all diverting is when b c smiths funky retroscore plays under a dimly lit chase scene giving it that fauxgritty vibe <>
director scott silver simply cant maintain that energy not when hes wasting time on choppy music video editing of his characters tender personal moments <>
the mod squad is busy and headacheinducing and rarely even manages to channel that into viscerally effective action <>
its just another lousy piece of brand name recycling so clearly pitched at a dumbeddown audience its surprising that when taking the time to define the films title they risked spotting us the the <>

[17198/4]
{-2} its okay for a horror film to be a metaphor in fact they can work best on an underlying psychological level <>
the original the thing and invasion of the body snatchers served as analogs to cold warera anticommunist paranoia while any number of takes on the vampire legend have delved into drug addiction effectively <>
a scary film can be more than just scary but it shouldnt work so hard at it that the whole thing becomes a pretentious preposterous mess <>
ravenous is just such a convoluted concoction throwing mountains of subtext at its tale of cannibalism in the vain hope that something might stick instead of merely ick <>
{-2} the setting for ravenous is a remote us army outpost called fort spencer a waystation hidden in the sierra nevadas of california circa <>
fort spencer is the new assignment of capt john boyd guy pearce a soldier bearing a tainted medal of honor after his cowardice led to an inadvertent triumph during the spanishamerican war <>
boyd discovers that fort spencer is populated by an odd crew of outcasts introspective col <>
hart jeffrey jones peyotefueled cook cleaves david arquette drunken doctor knox stephen spinella but the strangest case is yet another new arrival <>
his name is colqhoun robert carlyle a man discovered halfdead in the snow with quite a tale to tell <>
its the a tale of a stranded westward party that turned into a cannibalistic feast a tale of how the consumption of human flesh created a strange sort of monster <>
{1} every once in a while when ravenous settles down for some good oldfashioned terror tension you can almost enjoy it <>
there are a few nicely staged confrontations and creepy moments in antonia birds direction or perhaps that of milcho manchevski the director replaced two weeks into production including a sequence involving a sneak attack that builds far longer than you might think possible <>
writer ted griffin slips a few darkly comic lines into the dialogue and robert carlyles manic performance helps support that tone whenever hes on screen <>
{-2} how much more tolerable ravenous might have been if griffin and bird had been content to let the black comedy guide them <>
instead it becomes a potpourri of narrative notions and random themes the dehumanizing destruction of battle ie war itself as cannibalism the mad drive for the american frontier ie the manifest destiny as culturalecological cannibalism the equally mad drive for the gold in them thar hills ie the gold rush as economic cannibalism plus yet another gloss on addiction and on and on to a dizzying degree with the native american myth of the weendigo thrown in for good measure <>
boyds tortured quandary over whether to join this particular diners club is played as such grand opera infused with such sociopolitical baggage that guy pearce looks like hes carrying the entire weight of western civilization on his shoulders in every scene <>
{-2} no ones saying that the jaunty gruesomeness of eating raoul is the only possible approach for a successful foray into samespecies snacking <>
it may however be the best approach <>
when jeffrey jones is cracking wise while supping on a human stew ravenous begins to emerge from its coma of selfimportance when he pleads to be relieved of the misery of his hunger you wonder when he suddenly developed a character of any significance <>
at a certain point ravenous becomes so consumed with putting a heady spin on its subject matter that it consumes itself <>
a horror film with something to say between shocks is fine <>
its rare and annoying to find one that just wont shut up <>

{-1} hollywood has always been obsessed with youth but that obsession finally appears to be spinning out of control <>
in these halcyon days of n sync dawsons creek and the like it now seems that you can sell any pitch in hollywood by naming a piece of source material and tagging on the phrase but with teenagers <>
the most recent wave may have started with clueless jane austens emma but with teenagers and has since generated such classics as the faculty the thing but with teenagers and shes all that pygmalion but with teenagers <>
so why not cruel intentions <>
why not dangerous liaisons but with teenagers <>
{-2} because its a really lousy idea thats why made even worse by appalling execution <>
the principle players are sebastian valmont ryan phillippe and kathryn merteuil sarah michelle gellar manhattan stepsiblings who are birds of a poisonous feather <>
sebastian delights in deflowering innocents and building his reputation as a cad kathryn seeks vengeance on a sweet young thing named cecile selma blair who unwittingly stole away her boyfriend <>
united in their disdain for all other feeling human beings sebastian and kathryn strike a wager <>
it involves annette hargrove reese witherspoon a teen who has published a national magazine article trumpeting her virginity <>
sebastians mission is to seize that virtue or risk losing his classic car <>
if he wins his next conquest will be his own stepsister <>
{-2} if that all sounds considerably sleazier than the original dangerous liaisons thats only because it is <>
writerdirector roger kumble plays most of the film as though its softcore porn for teenyboppers teasing with pseudoincestuous fondling and moneyshot closeups of gellar and blair tongue kissing <>
to make matters even more unpleasant kumble even plays an interracial relationship for titillation value and goes for cheap laughs by introducing a pointless subplot in which a stud athlete eric mabius is a closet homosexual complete with gratuitous slurs <>
in a depressing case of lowest common denominator filmmaking kumble has appealed to his teen audience by reducing the themes of les liaisons dangereuses to everyone has sex with everyone else <>
{-2} in an even more depressing development kumble may actually have the best grasp of the source material <>
ryan phillippe in a valiant but grossly misguided effort to do some acting spends virtually the entire film aping john malkovichs performance in stephen frears dangerous liaisons <>
every inflectionless line reading every arched eybrow every lascivious doubleentendre is familiar with no apparent adjustment for the fact that sebastian is a contemporary teenager instead of an th century nobleman <>
gellar is only a bit better in the lipcurling glenn close role while selma blair plays cecile not as simple and innocent but with a fumbling idiocy that makes her every moment on screen unbearable <>
only reese witherspoon brings a shred of dignity to the proceedings continuing to show a wonderful presence for a young actress and an interest in finding something human in her character <>
{-2} unfortunately thats an interest her director doesnt share <>
i suppose it shouldnt be surprising that cruel intentions is just another in a long line of glossy high school audience flicks another film with a mindnumbingly incessant underscore of shufflebeats and pop songs another vehicle for pretty girls and even prettier boys to pose for their fans <>
it is sad however that these filmmakers have to keep picking promising source material for their libretti then demonstrating no concern for that material whatsoever <>
dangerous liaisons was a tale of corruption beneath a courtly veneer <>
cruel intentions makes the shocking suggestion that adolescents can be petty manipulative and obsessed with sex <>
its a stupid and pandering film which will probably appeal to its audience perfectly leaving the rest of us to sit back and wait for the inevitable moby dick but with teenagers <>

[16977/4]
{-1} the very concept behind high concept comedy is that the premise sells itself <>
a potential viewer can see one poster or one second commercial and understand instantly all the wacky comic possibilities schwarzenegger and devito as twins eddie murphy as the nutty professor robin williams as an iconoclastic medical student <>
the work is half done it seems as soon as the stars sign a contract <>
the reason so many high concept films are so mediocre is that no one bothers to do the other half of the work leaving a situation comedy thats entirely situation <>
{0} there was reason to hope for a bit more from analyze this since director harold ramis also directed and cowrote the decades best high concept comedy groundhog day <>
ramis setup this time around involves a new york mob boss named paul vitti robert deniro who is having some unfamiliar experiences shortness of breath crying jags difficulty ahem performing <>
in short vittis got stress <>
to help with the problem he visits psychiatrist ben sobol billy crystal and instantly becomes convinced that the doctor is a genius <>
suddenly the mildmannered doctor is expected to be at vittis service hours a day a severe inconvenience as ben prepares to get married to his fiancee lisa kudrow <>
{-2} as a pitch it probably sounded hilarious with deniro and crystal in the lead roles it probably seemed like a cantmiss mismatched tandem <>
instead analyze this is primarily a series of botched opportunities <>
the most glaring gaffe is the casting of crystal as sobol though at first glance he might appear to be ideal for the uptight therapist <>
early in the film we learn that ben is professionally dissatisfied sick of his whining patients and left in the shadow of his bestselling pop therapist father bill macy <>
not only does this bit of character background prove utterly pointless in the long run it emphasizes that ben could have been an interesting charcter if played by an actual actor <>
crystal simply cant avoid turning his every scene into shtick making a classic deadpan straightman part something perfect for say deniros midnight run partner charles grodin into something silly and clownish <>
{-2} and the parade of bad decisions only begins there <>
the remarkably talented lisa kudrow though given third billing is wasted in what amounts to the girlfriend part for a handful of scenes the rival gangster played by chazz palminteri which should have provided a nice counterpoint to the frazzled vitti barely registers as a character <>
perhaps most distracting is a constantly shifting tone that makes analyze this a candidate for its own multipletherapy session <>
while scenes of slapstick and comic misunderstanding are colliding with violent shootouts and emotional breakdowns theres never the feeling that ramis is aiming for an edgy dark comedy its just a high concept comedy into which other elements keep intruding <>
theres no narrative momentum to analyze this no sense of character consequence to keep it from turning into a repetitive series of sketch comedy scenes <>
{-2} theres at least one thing really right with analyze this and thats deniro <>
as many times as hes gone to the wiseguy well in his career mean streets the godfather part ii goodfellas the untouchables etc he always seems to find a new twist to keep it fresh <>
its fun watching him nod to his past when he comments on a godfatherinspired dream ben has its fun watching him work with the amusing joe viterelli as vittis main muscele man and its fun watching him show the comic chops he too rarely has a chance to employ <>
unfortunately hes wasting his performance on a movie that doesnt know what to do with its actors its premise oneupped by the current hbo series the sopranos or its character development <>
analyze this is a smaller scale example of what happens to so many summer blockbusters its a readymade marketing campaign to which a film has been attached almost as an afterthought <>

{-2} i dont think i want to know what andrew kevin walker dreams about <>
as to joel schumachers dreams i think i can venture a pretty good guess <>
walker is the scribe responsible for the monumentally disturbing seven a writer who seems far too fascinated with the horrifying outer limits of human depravity schumacher is a pop filmmaker who has served up glossy pseudocharacter studies on vigilantism falling down a time to kill and fetishized beefcake the two most recent batman extravaganzas <>
it would seem that the creative sensibilities of these two men couldnt be farther apart which is one of the reasons mm feels like an edgy intriguing missed opportunity <>
every time walker tries to drive the narrative into the realm of the unnerving schumacher drags it back into the merely kinky <>
{0} the premise for mm involves that most enduring of pornographic urban legends the snuff film <>
private investigator tom welles nicolas cage is hired by the widow of a recently deceased billionaire industrialist regarding one unpleasant item from his wall safe <>
its a single reel of mm film a film in which a teenage girl appears to be knifed to death by a man in a black leather hood <>
charged by his employer to find out whether or not the film is authentic welles begins to delve into the hollywood pornography underworld with a book store clerk named max joaquin phoenix as his guide <>
soon he discovers that there is always someone willing to cater to almost every sexual taste and that there are people in the world capable of things he never imagined <>
{-1} cage is a great choice for a character like tom welles the capacity for lunatic action always seems to hide just behind his placid features but the character himself is something of a puzzle <>
much is made in the opening minutes of toms happy marriage to his wife catherine keener and his love for his infant daughter which makes it a bit too obvious that his quest for the snuff films possible victim is really all about his own little girl <>
at times however it seems that walker and schumacher are playing with the idea that welles is recognizing some of his own darker desires through his experience <>
is mm a story of a man discovering the evil in society or the evil in himself <>
if that question had been answered more effectively mm might have struck a more resonant chord <>
{1} as it stands its still a pretty gripping little thriller at times <>
the first hour pokes along at something of a crawl which somehow works more often than it doesnt perhaps because its indicative of welles tenacity <>
the supporting performances are solid with joaquin phoenix making a savvy sidekick for welles and peter stormare seething sleaze as a porn film director <>
the deliberate pacing eventually gives way to some tense showdowns as the film builds to its climax including a search for a killer in which the driving sound of thrash metal music suddenly becomes the eerie metronome of the runout groove <>
mm is rarely a bore and often finds the slick energy of the most dark action films <>
{-2} its too bad that slickness works against mm nearly as often as it works for it <>
the bleak triumph of seven came not primarily through walkers fairly straightforward serial killer script but through director david finchers brilliantly subliminal direction <>
the violence lurked at the edges of the frame where our minds put gruesome pieces together <>
joel schumacher is a more grandiose sort of filmmaker one who has no problem thrusting the details of an sm film into the dead center of the screen <>
his version of the smoky basements where the hardcore deviants lurk is too literal and indeed theres something about tom welles entire journey that is too literal <>
the director isnt exactly trying to titillate the audience but hes not helping the writers study of how one man responds to the destruction of innocence <>
it may be enough that mm is just a decently constructed thriller <>
its just not a gutrattler more the sort of thing you get when the director of batman robin tries to do apocalyptic menace <>

clearly plenty of viewers and other critics eat up such portrayals with a spoon <>
i generally spend two hours watching a movie star failing miserably at suspending my disbelief <>
{0} the other sister is a ghastly exercise for any number of reasons but the primary reason is juliette lewis <>
lewis plays carla tate a yearold woman with a slight mental handicap who has spent several years in a special boarding school <>
returned at last to her wealthy san francisco family carla finds that the adjustment is difficult on both sides <>
her mother elizabeth diane keaton alternately coddles carla and pretends she is completely normal while father bradley tom skerritt quietly deals with his guilt at having sent her away at all <>
into this picture steps danny mcmahon giovanni ribisi a young man with a similar mental handicap living on his own <>
carla is inspired by his independence and tries to break away from her family even as she and danny become romantically attracted to each other <>
{-2} the setup for the other sister owes a major debt to the tvmovie like normal people in which linda purl and shaun cassidy played the developmentally challenged young people coping with familial opposition to their romance <>
leave it to director garry marshall to make a tvmovie look like a paradigm of subtlety and sensitivity <>
the other sister is nearly as big a narrative mess as marshalls allbutunwatchable dear god and as unabashedly candycoated as his pretty woman the disneydoeslesbians subplot involving carlas older sister is nearly as convincing as disneydoeshookers <>
the story leaps from episode to episode in search of a consistent tone dragging its fine cast through the muck along the way <>
diane keaton fusses and fumes as a parody of a patrician dame trying to ignore the lack of normalcy in her family tom skerritt fares better as the stolid slightly passive dad <>
theyre the worst kind of hollywood character constructions sitcom versions of mary tyler moore and donald sutherland in ordinary people <>
{-1} and the wacky premise for that sitcom just isnt funny <>
im sure that everyone involved in the other sister felt they were making a heartwarming tale of triumph over adversity which it very well might have been if there seemed to be a shred of authenticity to the situations <>
lewis is a large part of the problem and not necessarily because she does such a terrible job <>
its somehow easier to buy ribisi though his performance certainly isnt lightyears beyond lewiss <>
juliette lewis however is always juliette lewis from the first minute shes on screen until the last an actress trying to convince me shes a mentally handicapped person <>
watching lewis screw up her face and twist her dialogue becomes like watching a white actor playing a character in blackface not just a case of miscasting but wrong on a gut level <>
{-2} that reaction isnt mitigated by a script which frankly draws nearly every one of its laughs from the goofy behavior of its handicapped characters <>
viewers may kid themselves into thinking theyre laughing goodnaturedly at the struggles of these characters to be more like normal people but every gag is really at their expense <>
the other sister is a sideshow masquerading as a feelgood tale see the handicapped kids trying to figure out sex <>
see them get drunk and say inappropriate things <>
indeed the other sister stands as a shining example of all that can go wrong in a film about mentally handicapped people <>
in the rare examples that have worked leonardo dicaprio in whats eating gilbert grape tom hulce in dominick and eugene you felt someone was telling a real story of which handicapped characters happened to be a part <>

working with all the elements for a raw dramatic masterwork he appears unclear how to tell the story through to its conclusion <>
and in a fit of panic he turns the final minutes of the film into a mess of hamfisted plot summary and perplexing epilogue <>
{0} its a crying shame because the setup for affliction is so utterly compelling <>
nick nolte stars as wade whitehouse a lifetime resident of a small new hampshire town <>
recently divorced wade spends his days as a civil servant running the snowplow and serving as crossing guard while also acting as the towns lone parttime cop <>
hes trying to put his life back together even beginning a new relationship with a longtime friend named marge sissy spacek but his life has been permanently scarred by his abusive alcoholic pop james coburn <>
the death of his mother brings wade back into his fathers house rekindling longburied emotions just when his suspicions of foul play in a recent hunting accident have him on edge <>
{-2} the heart soul and twisted guts of affliction lie in nick noltes performance as wade as beatendown a human being as the screen has ever seen without turning him into a lovable loser <>
whipped into a psychological submission by his pop wade crawls through life on his belly working menial jobs at the whim of a town selectman holmes osborne feared and abandoned by his exwife and daughter because he has abandoned them emotionally taunted by a wealthy man to whom he tries to serve a traffic ticket <>
afraid of turning out anything like his father wade absorbs every bit of pain for fear that releasing it will cause him to lose control <>
hes tragic and pathetic and doomed and nolte nails him <>
{-2} schrader on the other hand doesnt seem convinced that he has nailed wade <>
the film opens with narration by wades younger brother rolfe willem dafoe narration which appears at irregular intervals <>
initially the narration is simply florid and unnecessary later it begins to repeat entire scenes just completed as though afraid we might have just walked in from the lobby and missed something <>
finally the narration becomes absolutely insufferable summing up every theme from the previous two hours in a few tidy sentences that makes you wonder why you spent your time with wade instead of his selfappointed shrink <>
that narration is part of an attrocious conclusion that nearly ruins the film tagging on explanations of much that has gone before and some that comes after <>
either schrader ran out of money to show us all this significant material or he ran out of ideas regarding how to do it <>
{1} perhaps such a gaping hole in the resolution of the protagonists story should have ruined the film but theres too much else that works in affliction <>
cinematographer paul sarossy who captured russell banks winter mindscapes previously in the sweet hereafter captures a sense of chilly isolation and the supporting cast notably coburns casually emasculating turn as pop is solid top to bottom <>
theres an ache at the core of affliction as painful as the rotting tooth that in a shakespearean display of psychic corruption manifested through physical corruption torments wade through much of the film <>
there will also be an ache in the head of many viewers as schrader spends the films critical final minutes beating them with a moral to the story that anyone able to add singledigit numbers should comprehend unassisted <>
it may have worked for travis bickle but here schraders use of narration nearly trumps noltes triumph <>
its enough to make an edgy critic ask are you still talkin to me <>

{0} theres more than a touch of irony to the title of the last days the first feature film project from steven spielbergs shoah foundation <>
on the surface it refers to the time when the films five principal subjects hungarianborn holocaust survivors tom lantos renee firestone alice lok cahana bill basch and irene zisblatt were taken from their homeland in as germany saw its chances at winning the war slip away and made a last desperate attempt to complete hitlers final solution <>
yet for these five people and thousands of other survivors like them the last days were only the beginning the first days of a lifetime spent trying to make sense of what had been taken from them <>
{2} its this concern with the world of the survivors rather than simply the world of the concentration camp internees that makes the last days more than just another holocaust documentary <>
the film is told entirely by witnesses to the holocaust without a moment of narration yet accounts of attrocities in the camps make up a relatively small portion of the film <>
there are certainly many powerful recollections in the survivor testimony the kind that can make you cry out in pain <>
irene zisblatt tells a tale of preserving the family diamonds that makes christopher walkens gold watch monologue in pulp fiction seem appallingly banal she describes seeing two children killed and realizing thats when i stopped talking to god <>
director james moll also uncovers rare footage for which no adjectives will suffice images shot by liberating allied forces of skeletal survivors walking in a ghostly parade <>
{-1} as effectively as the last days captures the during of the holocaust it also takes time to explore both the before and the after <>
if there is anywhere it disappoints it is in capturing the uniqueness of this particular before <>
bill basch ruefully notes in the films opening moments the absurdity of hitlers late push to add the hungarian jews to his european slaughter killing jews <>
basch says was more important than winning the war but moll doesnt build on that premise <>
while his focus on the survivors keeps the story personal it doesnt allow for a perspective on what was happening in the bigger picture of and how a different allocation of resources by the germans might have changed that picture <>
accounts of how hungarians believed the stories drifting in from poland could never happen in their own country feel more like generic backstory than a context for this particular phase of the genocide <>
{2} ultimately however moll finds his most powerful stories in the after <>
there is still minutes of screen time left when the war ends leaving us with stories of our five narrators trying to pick up the pieces <>
we see scenes of the survivors returned to birkenau and bergenbelsen with their families memories and tears washing over them <>
we see renee firestone visiting her childhood home and breaking down at finding a locked gate <>
we see firestone confronting a german concentration camp physician with evidence that he experimented on her sister receiving evasive responses to the medical records like yes everything normal <>
most significantly we see the survivors turning their experiences into art by lok cahana into political action by lantos now a california congressman into education for another generation by firestone in lectures <>
their days in concentration camps could have been the last days for these five individuals either for their lives or for their souls <>
the last days shows survivors in action seeking resolution working for a world that will never forget <>

{-2} suggestive references to balls and nuts to breasts to giving the finger to getting into someones pants to catching ones genitalia in ones zipper to contraception to virginity two references to urination a flatulence gag a couple of belches and a toiletseyeview of a fat guys rear end as he bemoans eating that last burrito <>
{1} welcome friends to the wonderful world of disney <>
{-1} in my favorite martian we discover that there is intelligent life in our solar system and that absolutely none of it was involved in making this film <>
continuing its impressive string of stupid and vulgar live action films disney this time recycles the s television series which starred bill bixby and ray walston <>
jeff daniels stars here as tim ohara a somewhat socially inept television news producer christopher lloyd is a martian who crashlands and poses as tims uncle martin while trying to repair his ship <>
along the way there are plenty of crazy misunderstandings and neardiscoveries including the suspicion by tims faithful camerawoman lizzie daryl hannah that he has the hots for her and the attempt by ambitious reporter brace channing elizabeth hurley to break the story of a close encounter <>
{-2} not surprisingly my favorite martian essentially consists of a series of scenes which present the opportunity to show off special effects <>
martin is able to appear in human form through the use of a special gum which also has unique effects on humans <>
he has a sentient wisecracking spacesuit called zoot uncredited voice by seinfelds wayne knight which does kooky things like pitching woo to a dress <>
he uses a molecular condenser to shrink objects like his space ship and tims plymouth dont even bother with scientific curiosities like why a molecular condenser also changes the weight of the object <>
when martin gets upset his body parts fall off <>
and viewers who enjoy that sort of thing and dont have trouble with the ridiculous notion of daryl hannah as a wallflower will giggle blithely along <>
{-2} trouble is most of those will be kids <>
yes my favorite martian sports a pg rating which clearly states that some material may not be suitable for children but lets get serious here <>
disney has turned the company name into a license to print money for family entertainment which used to mean something a parent wouldnt be embarrassed to take a kid to see <>
take a look at that list in the first paragraph above and you decide <>
this is filmmaking not for children but for idiots of all ages pandering with a sense of impunity because they havent exactly gone broke in the last couple of years by doing so <>
in a late scene when tim is admonished that humans should do something about the oceansand afternoon talk shows the hypocrisy of this film holding anything up to ridicule for its stupidity or offensiveness nearly burst a large vein in my forehead <>
how sad to see appealing comic performers like lloyd regurgitating bits from back to the future and wallace shawn as nasty government scientist dr elliot coleyee coli get it floundering in a mess like this <>
how much sadder still that people will pay to see it <>
{-2} there are maybe two harmless visual gags that work in my favorite martian and perhaps that many examples of real wit in the script <>
i liked the fact that martins molecular condenser makes a sound remarkably similar to rd when hes shot by the jawas in star wars the absurd parallel to ets revival also made me chuckle <>
mostly i sat in stony angry silence as this aggressively brainless film dribbled towards a sequelready conclusion tallying up the ways it treated viewers like preschoolers who laugh hysterically when they shout doodyhead at each other <>
remember that list next time you trust disneys name to mean anything but massmarket infantilism <>

{0} cinderella aint what she used to beand at the same time shes exactly what shes always been <>
like no other fairy tale setup it sets a modern sensibility to itching how does one respond to the idea that a woman must be physically transformed to be worthy of love <>
this male chauvinist pygmalion has taken many forms over the years from my fair lady to pretty woman but shes all that may have found the perfect setting high school <>
if theres anywhere you can sell the idea that everyone believes they must be physically transformed to be worthy of love this would be the place <>
{-2} so much for the sociological context shes all that stinks like last months cheese left on a particularly sunny windowsill <>
freddie prinze jr stars as zack siler senior class president soccer star and allaround golden boy at southern californias harrison high <>
on the first day back from spring break zack is dumped by longtime girlfriend taylor jodi lyn okeefe when she hooks up with a former real world cast member matthew lillard <>
the humiliated zack claims he can turn any girl in school into a prom queen a boast that turns into a bet when zacks buddy dean paul walker chooses gloomy art geek laney boggs rachael leigh cook as the subject of the experiment <>
and thus the eightweek countdown clock to personal growth and true love begins <>
{-2} im sure that all parties involved in shes all that thought they really were telling a cinderella story particularly director robert iscove who helmed the popular tvmovie version with brandy a couple years back <>
this of course is one of those cinderella stories where the poor little girl is really a supermodel whose paintspattered overalls hide a slinky vavavoom waiting to emerge <>
rachael leigh cook wears her hornrims like someone trying desperately not to appear beautiful despite her porcelain features somewhat dampening that willing suspension of disbelief <>
theres little if any chemistry between prinze and cook no development of what would make their mutual attraction growin short nothing that would appeal to a viewer not of the same age as the protagonists <>
{-1} essentially however shes all that isnt remotely interested in appealing to anyone outside that audience because its really a teen fantasy <>
for girls it offers the prospect that even if youre a social pariah now you too can turn into a popular beauty with the right haircut and a sympathetic stud by your side for boys it suggests that anyone is a hottie waiting to happen if you point her in the right direction <>
theres even assurance for the academically brilliant zack faces the dilemma of choosing between seven ivy league schools that your life is complicated too <>
and in between it derives belly laughs from people eating pizza sprinkled with pubic hair <>
its humorless and derivative but it understands you fellow high school student <>
like john hughes crossed with bill clinton shes all that feels your adolescent pain <>
{-2} thank heaven for matthew lillard who invests his spin on real worlds puck with enough egotistical energy to rouse shes all that from its stupor periodically <>
his scenes including a manic lookatme dance at a party are about the only aspect of the film not pasted together from every other teen angstcomedy youve ever seen <>
this one compounds its tedium with a nearsuffocating boredom as iscove cant even generate energy to drive its familiar narrative forward <>
shes all that just meanders sweetly towards its inevitable conclusion telling its viewers exactly what they want to hear that someday their prince will come and all it will take to get him is a sausagecasing red dress <>

{0} if its december or january it must be time for triumph over illnesshandicap films <>
they spew forth during oscar season like colored hankies from a magicians sleeve playing to the academys timehonored tradition of tossing nominations at anyone who hops into a hospital bed or occupies a wheelchair or otherwise tackles physical or mental adversity <>
into this crowded field comes the theory of flight a quirky comedydrama of romantic friendship starring kenneth branagh as richard hawkins an artist so flighty that he actually does try to take flightright off the roof of a building <>
for his trouble richard is sentenced to community service which takes the form of assisting jane hatchard helena bonham carter a young woman stricken with als better known in the us as lou gehrigs disease and confined to a wheelchair <>
she wants only one thing from richard for him to help her realize her lifes dream before she dies <>
cue soaring music and inspirational message <>
{0} well not exactly <>
it seems that janes lifes dream is to lose her virginity <>
nonetookeen on doing the deed himself richard instead decides to rent her a gigolo for one night <>
and nonetoowealthy being a flighty artist he decides to rob a bank to pay for it <>
thus unfolds a singularly odd sort of film at once a dark comedy an unconventional love story and yes a triumph over illnesshandicap film <>
{-1} the strange thing about the theory of flight is that its not always clear whose triumph over a handicap will be the focus of the film <>
as the narrative progresses it becomes ever more clear that richard is the real protagonist of the piece the character who is supposed to learn and change through this experience <>
unfortunately hes also the character who is least interesting and makes the least sense <>
theres something emotionally amiss with this fellow thats for certain exactly what that something is not so much <>
kenneth branagh apparently still suffering side effects from channeling woody allen in celebrity is all neurotic discomfort and goofy twitches <>
the characters intense desire to follow through on the bank robbery falls somewhere between melodramatic affectation and sincerethoughmisguided expression of resolve when only one or the other would truly clarify things <>
{1} meanwhile helena bonham carter continues to act circles around most of her contemporaries <>
jane is a superb piece of characterization never merely the selfpitying hardontheoutsidesoftontheinside person with a handicap that has become such a cinematic cliche <>
theres wicked selfdeprecating humor in the character she posts a message to an internet personals board stating hideously crippled young woman seeks sex but also an innocent wistfulness <>
though its a challenging bit of physical acting for bonham carter to wrap her mouth around janes slurred speech and adopt the distinctive movements her finest moment is a silent one a pleading glance at richard as her voice synthesizer plays her recorded request <>
{-1} its the clash between our interest in those two characters which prevents the theory of flight from soaring to the highest possible level <>
while richards awakening to his own selfindulgence may be the point its still tedious watching him indulge himself when watching jane is so much more interesting <>
perhaps the problem is that there is too much highconcept to this tale too many silly little bits of business to distract from genuine interaction between the two principal characters <>
its hard for a love story to be great when you want one of the lovers to end up happy and the other just to end up an adult <>
you have to commend the theory of flight for taking a slightly different flight plan towards soaring inspiration <>
it just cant quite get there on only one good wing <>

[16126/6]
{-1} the announcement that the thin red line would mark terrence malicks return to the directors chair after a twenty year absence was greeted as the cinematic equivalent of j d salinger popping open his smithcorona to give it another go <>
this was after all the hermitgenius of great american moviemaking whose only two previous films badlands and days of heaven were spoken of in tones of reverence <>
yet try as i might i couldnt work up the same enthusiasm <>
as adept as malick was at crafting stunning visuals narrative seemed to be an afterthought to him something to be cobbled together with voiceover narration <>
good films yes and profoundly beautiful ones but not profound ones <>
{1} malick reaches for profundity once again in the thin red line the result is another good greatlooking tone poem where deep thoughts stand in the way of genuine drama <>
based on james jones novel it tells the tale of the world war ii guadalcanal campaign through the eyes of several members of a us army rifle company called cforcharlie <>
malick weaves his way through the minds and eyes of several characters as cforcharlie prepares for its first action including company commander capt <>
staros elias koteas an officer concerned about his men lt col tall nick nolte the batallion commander who sees this campaign as a careermaking opportunity pvt witt jim caviezel an idealist who repeatedly goes awol sgt welsh sean penn whose cynicism hides a heart and pvt bell ben chaplin whose every thought is focused on his wife back home <>
{-1} its instantly clear that malick intends to take the thin red line in a very different direction from jones novel <>
jones while he frequently found his way into the heads of his characters was equally concerned with providing a vivid sense of the physical the oppressive heat and humidity the boots full of water and the insect attacks that challenged the men on guadalcanal before a single shot was fired <>
for long stretches of the thin red line malick seems to forget that these characters have bodies at all <>
the narration captures the men thinking about god about the nature of evil about their lives and loves <>
the incessant koanlike philosophizing becomes aggravating enough but its even more frustrating that every one of the men from the law schooleducated staros to kentuckybred farm boy witt thinks in the same collegesophomoreona doublebonghit myfingernailcouldbeawholenotheruniverse terms <>
with only a couple of notable exceptions bells obsessive love for his wife and talls careerist selfloathing malicks internal monologues turn the characters into an indistinct jumble of existential angst <>
{1} ironically the thin red line is at its best when it does get down and dirty following the companys assault on a welldefended japanese hill position <>
its a superb piece of kinetic war filmmaking the camera bursting through tall grass as soldiers are cut down during a suicidal headon attack <>
it is here during the heat of battle that malick finds his most affecting and insightful moments a platoon sergeant woody harrelson facing a greater threat from his own carelessness than from the enemy doll reacting to his first kill staros and tall facing off over a risky attack order <>
theres more poetry and insight as the men discover what battle will make of them than there is in an hours worth of navelgazing and heavyhanded juxtapositions of war bad and nature good <>
{-1} theres little question that the thin red line is an aesthetic wonder shot by john toll in fickle available light and edited into a wartime koyaanisqatsi <>
and it all might have worked much better if malick had let viewers draw their own messages from the images rather than letting a soldier inform us that war dont ennoble menit turns em into dogs poisons the soul <>
even that tactic might have worked better if the voices had been distinctive or if there were some exploration of esprit de corps which connected these men to one another <>
each character in the thin red line is living too squarely inside his own head to connect much with anyone else <>
that sentiment applies to terrence malick as well who returns from his two decade sabbatical for three hours of stunningly photographed overwrought introspection <>

[16115/4]
{-2} somehow theres something even more icky about an exploitative and routine horror film that tarts up its exploitation and routineness with plenty of style <>
such is the case with neil jordans in dreams a psychological thriller which lets its atmospheric creepiness disintegrate into a trite chasenterrorize puree <>
annette bening stars as claire cooper a massachusettsbased childrens book illustrator with a picturebook life lovely rural new england home loving husband paul aidan quinn beautiful young daughter rebecca katie sagora and loyal dog dobie <>
she also posesses a spark of psychic ability which she has had all her life one which seems to be getting stronger as she has visions connected to the disappearance of a local schoolgirl <>
then rebecca is abducted and claire comes to believe that she is psychically connected to a serial killer and that the killer is similarly connected to her <>
{1} for a while it looks like in dreams is going to be a thriller of a different stripe something as dramatically and visually compelling as it is viscerally shocking <>
darius khondji the gifted cinematographer behind seven gives in dreams the same menacing silver tint and twisted light including an eerie opening underwater sequence in a submerged town <>
the story takes claire on a descent into genuine madness the kind that makes a character truly unpredictable and interesting to watch <>
bening is a superb actress and she makes the most of claire fumbling for answers with the last shreds of her sanity <>
the script also presents the idea that the killer is a tormented soul who wants claire to catch him setting up a potentially complex relationship when they finally do meet <>
{-1} gradually however in dreams starts to lose its way <>
partly it seems rushed with scenes slammed together too quickly to develop the necessary foreboding <>
partly it seems sloppy increasingly depending on ridiculous contrivances claire being confined in exactly the same room once occupied by the killer for instance and the blandly counterproductive analysis of claires psychiatrist jordan regular stephen rea sporting a distracting accent <>
and partly it seems meanspirited using graphic murders for shock value or imperiled children for sympathy value rather than building interest in the characters <>
over its final minutes in dreams begins a slow but steady descent from potent psychological thriller to careless mess <>
{-2} and then when robert downey jr finally appears as the killer vivian it careens out of control entirely <>
decked out in flowing red tresses and whispering in an effeminate drawl downey exercises every ghastly overacting muscle in his body simultaneously <>
to be fair to downey the role is a serial killer cliche hes a norman bates mommas boy with serious gender role issues without a remotely sympathetic quality dashing hopes of a mindgame showdown into the rocks <>
instead its all guns and sharp objects running and screaming until a bleak unsatisfying and confounding resolution <>
its a huge disappointment coming from neil jordan a filmmaker who has consistently made films that defied expectations the company of wolves the crying game the butcher boy <>
in a sad way thats exactly what he does here <>
just when you expect in dreams might turn out to be a memorably disturbing horror film it turns out to be a gutless nihilistic tease <>

[16090/4]
{0} it would be trite to compare west texas high school football to a religion <>
it would also be inaccurate religious faithful generally demonstrate some sense of proportion <>
a cult would be more analagous with thousands of people connecting their happiness to the achievements of mere mortals to whom greater powers are ascribed <>
or perhaps rudimentary tribal warfare is more appropriate <>
or even basic psychological child abuse <>
in short the singular phenomenon that is west texas high school football is the stuff of which great american stories could be made <>
{0} or varsity blues could be made <>
this glossy youth melodrama stars dawsons creek poster boy james van der beek as jonathan mox moxon a bookish senior backup quarterback for the west canaan tx coyotes <>
mox plays football because its what youre expected to do in west canaan but hes content to remain in the shadow of his best friend star quarterback lance harbor paul walker while waiting for admission to brown university <>
then a seasonending knee injury sidelines lance forcing the capable and creative mox into the spotlight and into the line of fire of autocratic revered and feared coyote coach bud kilmer jon voight <>
{-1} the bulk of the film involves moxs response to the adulation his new role as star brings him will mox be true to himself and his girlfriend julie amy smart or will he be seduced by fame football and head cheerleader darcy ali larter <>
as the exceedingly pleasant van der beek plays him theres never much question at all <>
mox is a boy scout whose only lapse in judgment occurs in an effort at another good deed bringing lance out to a strip club to cheer him up hes a broad strokes hero like kilmer whos not only a martinet but a racist just for good measure is a broad strokes villain <>
at least a couple of the supporting characters notably scott caan as the team wild man and ron lester as a massive lineman show sparks of life <>
dramatically mox is a flatline <>
{-1} that inconsequential plot progression wastes plenty of potentially compelling conflict <>
moxs father thomas duffy himself a former coyote is proud of his straighta student son for the first time when mox becomes a football star yet that relationship is played only for laughs or speeches <>
the emotional center of varsity blues should have been the pressure and twisted values that make high school kids believe nothing they ever do will be as valuable a sentiment expressed in kilmers pep talk that the big game is minutes for the next years of your lives <>
though director brian robbins making a dramatic leap from good burger nails the atmosphere of abandoned friday night streets w peter iliffs script uses it mostly as scenery for a typical teen soap opera <>
its as though they went to the amish country then decided to make dawsons creek the movie <>
{-1} of course the intended audience for varsity blues is the same as the audience for dawsons creek high school students themselves little interested in studies of small town sociology <>
its worth noting that robbins and ilif include at least a few insightful scenes including one players rage against how much hes always hated the game between the obligatory ta and partyhearty scenes <>
this isnt the last picture show were talking about nor was it ever likely to be but it could have aimed for something slightly more ambitious than a climax where all that matters is whether the coyotes can win the big game <>
thats not just uninspired given the setting its painfully ironic <>

its something only six students sensitive drug dealer zeke josh hartnett tormented geek casey elijah wood blackclad loner stokely clea duvall cheerleader delilah jordana brewster quarterback stan shawn hatosy and sweet new girl in school marybeth laura harris seem to recognize <>
it starts in the faculty including the football coach robert patrick and the principal bebe neuwirth then slowly spreads to their classmates <>
herrington high has been overtaken by a worldshaking case of deja vu <>
{-2} its not just that another film from earlier this year disturbing behavior already suggested a sinister conspiracy to turn high school students into obedient robots <>
deconstructionist screen scribe kevin williamson managed a tightrope act across the fine line between homage and outright theft in scream and scream <>
in the faculty he stomps that fine line into a fine paste <>
the tommy hilfigerbedecked sextet of protagonists shows the meticulous crosssectioning of the breakfast club <>
their test of each others humanity is a crib from john carpenters the thing <>
their last stand locked away from the menace out there recalls night of the living dead aliens and any number of other science fiction thrillers <>
its a monster movie that could not exist without the existence of other and much better movies <>
{-1} of course some will argue that such is entirely the point of any williamson project that he shows off the conventions of genre films so he can revitalize them <>
the problem is that there is nothing remotely revitalizing about the faculty <>
sure its a movie movie but its quotes are as witlessly regurgitated as in any number of recent leslie nielsen projects <>
instead of having something clever to say about cliches it simply recycles them tossing in the occasional reference to the puppet masters or aliens ripley as though it suddenly makes all the trite characterizations and profanely insultfilled dialogue tolerable <>
even elijah woods wideeyed genuineness and some pseudoanalysis of teenage desire for conformity cant rescue the faculty from feeling exactly like the attractive teens in jeopardy tales it supposedly derides <>
{-1} if the faculty proves anything its how much williamson needs wes craven <>
both scream films featured chilling sequences which could stand with the best the genre had to offer they showed what chould be great about horror films even as they showed what could be awful about them <>
robert rodriguez who if nothing else has always shown that he has an electrifying sense of cinematic pacing seemingly has no idea what to do with this material <>
the faculty drifts sluggishly from character to character as though they actually mattered and the few action sequences are designed to show off alien effects <>
every opportunity for genuine creativity is turned into yet another selfsatisfied commentary on how every sciencefiction story is really a ripoff of some other sciencefiction story <>
{-1} there are a couple of amusing moments in the faculty a football game in which the herrington team infects the opposition during dogpile tackles for instance but even most of those are taken from other films <>
williamsons name is supposed to make this a knowing satire of alien takeover films like invasion of the body snatchers but there was more inventive humor in a piece of cheese like s killer yogurt film the stuff <>
i kept waiting for either fun or fear and all i got was a jokey cameo by internet gossip guru harry aintitcool knowles <>
the faculty merely adds to the list of lame science fiction films for someone else to satirizeand maybe even get it right next time <>

{-1} its difficult to explain how minutes of effortless charm could be neutralized by one scene without giving away the ending of waking ned devine <>
as a film critic i almost always champion films that take narrative risks avoiding the plague of the obvious <>
waking ned devine takes just such a risk but the result feels like a particularly nasty baitandswitch <>
where many films err with gratuitous sentimentality this one errs with a gratuitous lack of sentimentality <>
{1} the most frustrating thing is that so much of it is so entertaining <>
set in the coastal irish hamlet of tulaigh mhor it centers on jackie oshea ian bannen and michael osullivan david kelly two elderly friends among the towns inhabitants <>
one morning jackie makes the connection from a newspaper headline that a winning lottery ticket was purchased in tulaigh mhor meaning one of the other townspeople is now very wealthy and very desirable as a friend <>
after narrowing down the field of contenders jackie realizes the winner must be fisherman ned devine <>
unfortunately ned is in no position to claim his prize having dropped dead from shock while watching the numbers announced on television <>
{2} thus begins a sparkling bit of farce as jackie michael and eventually the entire town conspire to share in the late neds good fortune <>
when lottery offical jim kelly brendan f dempsey arrives from dublin to verify the winner michael is forced into the unfamiliar role of actor posing as ned so the million pound jackpot wont go without a claimant <>
both lead actors are splendid bannen the gleeful mastermind behind the plan and kelly the flustered star of his show <>
the sequence in which jackie and michael try to set up the deception caught offguard by mr kellys early arrival shows director kirk jones to have a rare sort of comic timing <>
farce rarely works on film the way it works on a stage but waking ned devine fires on every cylinder game actors in a great comic situation guided by a talented director <>
{1} theres also a major subplot in waking ned devine a romantic triangle of sorts between single mother maggie susan lynch gentle but foulsmelling pig farmer finn james nesbitt and selfsatisfied ladies man pat mulligan matthew devitt <>
initially the whole business seems to be little more than a distraction an excuse for gags about odor and fruity soaps <>
gradually however it begins to take shape as the ideal setup for the storys lesson <>
finn loves his work as a pig farmer but maggie will only marry him if he gives it up <>
will the lottery windfall in which hell share change finn into a more suitable husband yet a less satisfied man <>
how will riches change all the citizens of tulaigh mhor <>
{-1} and it is here friends that waking ned devine takes its left turn into black comedy and bleak morality <>
plenty of viewers will walk away from waking ned devine believing they have seen a feelgood film with a happy ending but it is an entirely contrary reaction which blunted my enthusiasm <>
i laughed and laughed and laughed through much of the film <>
then i gasped <>
then i fumed <>
waking ned devine sheds its sympathy and its sense of good humor for what in retrospect feels like a cheap shock and a toast to situational ethics <>
minutes of effortless charm counts for a lot <>
if only one scene didnt make it count for so much less <>

{1} mighty joe young gives the most noteworthy performance in mighty joe young which is only to be expected <>
after all like the dinosaurs in jurassic park or the tornados in twister another film in which bill paxton is upstaged by a special effect the big ape is the only reason anyone might want to see the film <>
in this bigbudget remake of the ersatz king kong a combination of monkey suit computer animation and electronics replace ray harryhausen stopmotion to provide a more versatile range of emotion <>
the goal was a sympathetic simian a foot ton o love you couldnt help but cheer for <>
{-1} all evidence suggests that making joe a crowdpleasing character was all anyone involved in mighty joe young cared about and they couldnt even get that right <>
they begin by making him an orphan his mother killed by poachers in africa on the same night that anthropologist dr ruth young linda purl leaves her own daughter an orphan trying to save the apes <>
twelve years later american zoologist gregg ohara bill paxton comes to africa to investigate legends of a giant ape and discovers joe to be real and his caretaker dr youngs daughter jill charlize theron to be beautiful <>
ohara offers joe protection at a los angeles nature preserve but danger lurks in the person of strasser rade sherbedgia the killer of joe and jills parents who has both dollar signs and vengeance on his mind <>
{-1} mighty joe young can only work on a story level if joe is not a monster but a sensitive misunderstood stranger in a strange land like a hirsute e t <>
unfortunately there is not a shred of internal logic to joes personality <>
at times hes a big playful kid at other times for no apparent reason other than a cheap laugh hes a superintelligent beast who shakes his head ironically and escapes from pursuers with cleverlyexecuted diversionary tactics <>
one minute hes looking at ohara as an enemy and a rival for jills affection and the next hes holding oharas hand like theyre old pals <>
even joes situational sense of morality makes it hard to care about him as he dispatches villains with the kind of ruthlessness youd expect of james bond not the furry hero of a disney movie <>
joes not a character hes a contrivance manipulated by technicians for whatever tone suits the needs of the moment <>
{-2} that leaves the human characters and oh what a scary mistake that turns out to be <>
charlize theron is a tremendously appealing actress but shes instantly ridiculous traipsing around the jungle in a designer coiffure bill paxton fares little better as the earnest bland hero you expect at any moment will scold the villain with hes in it for the money not the science <>
they get to wander together in a couple of canned romantic interludes so absurd youll want to shoot yourself in the thigh with a tranquilizer dart <>
the rest of the cast consists of obligatory types the intransigent authority figure the henchman etc and obligatory cameos from the original terry moore and ray harryhausen himself all standing around waiting for joe to go on his actionpacked climactic rampage <>
{-1} there are plenty of viewers to whom none of this will matter in the slightest provided mighty joe young delivers its share of family adventure <>
in fact it works sporadically on that level with a couple of lively chases and some whoopitup destruction on hollywood boulevard <>
im just not sure what kids will make of the violence joe inflicts on innocent bystanders or his streak of homicidal vigilantism <>
its telling that the film has to put a child in jeopardy in the final ten minutes to make joes noble heart evident and have the child plead for the apes wellbeing with a wideeyed is joe gonna be all right <>
all the filmmakers needed to do for mighty joe young to work on a basic level was make it easy to root for joe <>
instead the only character that matters in a disney film no less is an unstable illdefined murderer <>
say it aint so joesay it aint so <>

{-2} about forty minutes into stepmom i came to a numbing realization well two actually <>
the first was that i knew exactly where this domestic drama was headed and could predict scenes and confrontations far down the road <>
the second was that i knew we were still minutes away from the closing credits <>
as the film eversoslowly unfolded i began to realize what five credited screenwriters can buy you perhaps the most inefficient screenplay of the year <>
{1} theres some promising human drama in the premise which begins with conflict in an extended family <>
photographer isabel kelly julia roberts living with divorced attorney luke harrison ed harris is struggling to gain the acceptance of lukes daughter anna jena malone and son ben liam aiken <>
making the task even harder is lukes exwife jackie susan sarandon who undercuts isabel at every turn and rails at her every parenting miscue <>
what isabel doesnt know is that jackie is battling an even tougher adversary than a potential stepmother for her children cancer <>
as she confronts her mortality jackie also confronts her fears of being replaced in her childrens hearts <>
{-1} thats an interesting enough twist on the complicated emotions and allegiances of extended family interactions one that could have made a tidy feature weeper <>
unfortunately absolutely nothing about stepmom could be called tidy <>
if a situation or relationship calls for a scene to establish it stepmom provides two or three <>
isabel bonds with anna over an art project one of the films few truly affecting moments then bonds with her over a musical number everyone panics over ben when he disappears in a park then panics over ben when he falls off a jungle gym <>
stepmom appears to have no faith that well understand the significance of a characters actions unless those actions are underlined making it both insulting and redundant <>
every turn of character is so deliberately structured you might suspect that every subsequent screenwriter came in just to add another half dozen scenes and no one threw anything out <>
{-2} stepmoms narrative unwieldiness also makes it extremely hard to connect with any of the many plot lines <>
isabel struggles with balancing career and her new family jackie struggles with balancing her health and her family anna struggles with how she should respond to the new woman in her fathers life and ben played by liam aiken with the kind of fulsome adorableness that gives child actors a bad name struggles to find new things to giggle at <>
ed harris meanwhile struggles just to find a few minutes of screen time <>
with all the complexities involved in these family dynamics dear old dad remains a complete enigma <>
youre a great dad jackie tells luke in once scene i just never gave you the chance to realize it <>
that sentiment will probably apply to the entire audience which may forget theres a father anywhere to be found <>
for a film about getting your priorities straight stepmom sure doesnt <>
{-1} of course its understood that this is to be a showcase for the two lead actresses and we shouldnt begrudge them a showcase when lead actresses generally get the treatment harris gets here <>
roberts and sarandon are both quite good in their roles sarandon in particular bringing a wonderful steely maternalism <>
theyre just stuck in the kind of film which has become director chris columbus specialty cheap comic relief which gives way to big messages of understanding <>
stepmom is a big emotional mess of a movie one which grows increasingly irritating as karaoke production numbers and one tearful goodbye after another chew up minutes of screen time <>
good actors deserve better than a script that strangely enough looks like pieces of the work of five different writers stitched together to form a movie <>

{0} people will probably misinterpret the documentary out of the past as much as the controversial event which is at its center which is irony enough <>
it would be even more ironic if they misinterpret it in exactly the same way without any direct knowledge because they are already convinced they know what its about <>
such tends to be the case when you are dealing with the perpetually volatile subject of homosexuality <>
it happens even more frequently when the suggestion is proferred that gays and lesbians are human beings with much to contribute to the world <>
{0} that and that alone is the fierce conviction behind out of the past <>
the story which serves as its jumpingoff point is the tale of kelli peterson an out lesbian who attempted during her senior year at salt lake citys east high school to start a student club called the gaystraight alliance <>
its purpose according to peterson was understanding understanding between gay students that they were not going through the difficult experience alone understanding between gay and straight students that gays were not aliens to be feared or hated <>
local school board members legislators and parents in conservative utah however believed the club was an unwholesome influence promoting the lifestyle of homosexuality and wanted the club eliminated <>
faced with the federallymandated choice between permitting all extracurricular clubs including the gaystraight alliance and banning all clubs the school board opted for the latter <>
{2} that story alone would be compelling enough to make for a solid piece of documentary filmmaking <>
peterson emerges as a determined remarkably mature young woman with a surprisingly wry sense of humor about the uproar she never meant to cause <>
its fascinating and entertaining simply watching her calm determination in the face of parents who announce their concerns in board meetings that exposure to homosexuality will be a dangerous influence on impressionable teenagers <>
the issue for the forces in opposition to the gaystraight alliance isnt just their undoubtedly sincere belief in the immorality of homosexuality <>
they desire nothing less than the invisibility of homosexuals believing perhaps that if no one talks about them they will simply go away <>
{1} that widelyheld societal belief drives even more fascinating secondary story in out of the past a series of biographical vignettes intertwined with kelli petersons struggle <>
the vignettes describe individuals i was embarrassed and angry to discover that i had never heard of gay americans who contributed to the arts political thought and social justice <>
the most intriguing of these is bayard rustin a member of martin luther king jrs inner circle of advisors who was the architect of nonviolent civil resistance and the primary organizer of the march on washington <>
rustin became a lighting rod for opposition both from segregationists like strom thurmond and from other black political leaders <>
like many others he has been excised from history books because of his sexual orientation contributing to the continued invisibility of gay americans as role models <>
{1} like many talking head documentaries out of the past does have its slow patches and not all the biographical sketches are uniformly enlightening <>
ultimately however the film does what it sets out to do it places kelli peterson in a historical context validating the legacy which she had been denied <>
it was the societal denial of that legacy which made a gaystraight alliance necessary in the first place it was the search for heroes that turned kelli peterson into one <>

[14516/3]
{-2} as evidence of my exodus from the land of hip i offer the confession that its been about three years since ive seen an episode of saturday night live <>
i gave up on producer lorne michaels round about the time he was turning snl sketches into hideous excuses for feature films from the coneheads shudder to stuart saves his family shudder shudder to its pat full grand mal seizure <>
the show that used to be cutting edge had turned into a pop culture butter knife dull and pointless <>
{-1} if a night at the roxbury is any indication i havent missed much from snl other than an attempt to recapture past glory by regurgitating old premises <>
steve will ferrell and doug butabi chris kattan the socially intept utterly oblivious nightclubbing la siblings whose attempts to score from one of the films plot lines are pretty familiar creations <>
the butabis are basically a postdisco gloss on the czechoslovakian brothers played by dan aykroyd and steve martin twenty years ago they of the wideopen shirt collars and wild and crazy guys fingerpointing <>
only the lingo appears to have changed <>
you say tomato i say tomahto you say foxes i say babes <>
{-1} im not suggesting that a film based on the czechoslovakian brothers necessarily would have been funnier than this one <>
its almost axiomatic at this point that trying to turn a five minute sketch into a fulllength feature is a very very bad idea particularly when those five minute sketches are only funny for the first two <>
the fact is its briefly amusing watching the butabis synchronized headswaying to the beat or listening to them spew out decrepit pickup lines <>
but the rest of a night at the roxbury demonstrates exactly what kills sketchtofeature concepts once the sketch material is exhausted youve got to humanize characters that are much funnier as broad caricatures <>
doug and steve even though they still live at home with their parents dan hedaya and loni anderson are really guys with a dream to create their own nightclub with the help of roxbury owner mr zadir an uncredited chazz palminteri <>
do you think the czechoslovakian brothers would be hysterical as earnest immigrants who decide to clean up their act and improve their english skills <>
{-2} when a night at the roxbury isnt just plain boring its actually kinda sad <>
in case the taut visage of loni anderson wasnt frightening enough the film wheels out richard grieco as himself doughy and mascaracovered <>
the idea that grieco still carries enough clout to get our loser protagonists into the ultraexclusive roxbury is one of the films best jokes dana carvey would have dismissed him in an old snl sketch with an admonition to wait at the bar <>
its nearly as sad watching other snl cast members molly shannon colin quinn mark mckinney turn up as though they were in need of lorne michaels charity <>
and its saddest of all being a member of the audience watching the script scramble in search of a concept on which to hang something vaguely humorous and watching director john fortenberrys clunky comic pacing <>
{-1} ultimately there are about five decent laughs and another handful of chuckles in a night at the roxbury and i was counting those in the stony audience around me not my own <>
ill give ferrell and kattan credit for a clever combopoke at say anything and the graduate and ill give major credit to the music supervisor for coming up with great song cues for a number of scenes <>
otherwise a night at the roxbury continues two noteworthy saturday night live traditions loser brothers infatuated with trendy nightspots and generally unwatchable feature films <>
looks like i could pick up right where i left off <>

{1} for what its worth matt healys script for clay pigeons is remarkably unpredictable as film scripts go <>
it opens in a montana field where buddies clay joaquin phoenix and earl gregory sporleder are drunkenly firing away at empty bottles of bud <>
the friendliness ends however when earl reveals to clay that hes aware of clays afair with earls wife amanda georgina cates <>
the humiliated earl kills himself having set up clay to take the fall <>
it looks for all the world like clay pigeons is about to become a trouble with harrystyle black comedy with clay desperately trying to hide dead bodies while scorned woman amanda makes his life more complicated by the moment <>
{0} suddenly the film takes a hard right turn with the arrival in town of lester long vince vaughn a jovially vulgar truck driver who bonds with clay over brews and a game of pool <>
the two go fishing together only to discover a floating corpse <>
lester seems particularly keen to avoid any connection with the body which makes more sense when another dead body turns up in town <>
what begins to look like a twisted battle of wills between clay and lester then takes another sharp turn with the arrival of fbi agents to investigate the dead body led by special agent dale shelby janeane garofolo <>
bigcity shelby doesnt by clays folksy protestations of innocence leading to culture clash <>
is it a serial killer thriller a dark comedy or a tarantinoera spin on smalltown stagnation the last picture show with stab wounds and copious use of a certain fword <>
{-1} i didnt mind not knowing from one moment to the next where clay pigeons might take me <>
i did mind that by the time i got where it was taking me i didnt much care <>
joaquin phoenix brings his wounded sensitive demeanor to clay making him a sympathetic enough protagonist in spite of his flaws <>
director david dobkin on the other hand doesnt seem nearly as interested in investing us in clays plight or the hints that clays learning something about himself through it all <>
hes going for atmosphere with a capital a lingering on drifting clouds and slowmotion inserts <>
just when he should be trying for some hook into the story whether emotional or comedic dobkin lets the narrative get progressively grimmer chillier and more remote <>
its a ticandflourish film in search of a solid center <>
{-1} its a shame he couldnt have done more with an intriguing eccentric cast <>
vince vaughn perhaps using lester as a dry run for his turn as norman bates in the upcoming psycho remake gives his amiable drifter an unsettling edge to go with his hollow laugh <>
janeane garofolo tries to give her ironic observations on smalltown ways some bite but her character always seems to belong in a slightly different movie <>
elements like the towns dimwitted deputy never mesh with the sinister undertones of vaughns mysterious drifter <>
a film that could have been a quirky original instead feels merely offputting as though the director is daring the audience to find something to enjoy <>
unpredictability can only carry a film so far clay pigeons makes you feel like a sucker for coming along for the ride <>

{0} hey did you ever hear the one about the really good postscream teen horror film <>
it seems that some filmmakers realizing there was a new market to be tapped after the success of scream and its sequel decided to make an even better variation on the theme <>
the script was intelligent the obligatory pop culture asides felt more than obligatory and the suspense was genuinely scary <>
it was both fresh and frightening <>
no really it actually happened <>
a friend of my cousins sisterinlaw actually saw it <>
{-1} sorry friends but the preceding is a myth an urban legend if you will exactly the kind which forms the basis of the film of the same name <>
you see the story on the northeastern us campus of pendleton college goes that a psycho professor murdered a dorm full of students years ago but the administration hushed it up <>
now as the silver anniversary approaches more nastiness is going on <>
a young woman is decapitated by a figure in the back seat of her car another is killed in a darkened room while her rommate lies blissfully sleeping <>
all of it is somehow connected to natalie simon alicia witt a student with a dark secret in her past but who is murdering students based on urban legends <>
hot shot school reporter paul jared leto <>
frat boy prankster damon joshua jackson <>
folklore professor wexler erstwhile freddy krueger robert englund <>
or some other disgruntled soul <>
{-2} if you actually care about the answer to that question by the end of urban legend it will only be to see how convoluted the explanation could be <>
like too many recent horror films this one obliges you to play name that killer without giving you enough information to permit anything but a random guess <>
and if you think abut the revelation for long enough afterwards youll realize it just doesnt matter <>
memo to horror filmmakers we dont need to be guessing whos behind michael myers mask in order for him to be threatening <>
stop wasting our time this is a slasher film not agatha christie <>
{-1} frankly its about time slasher films started acting like slasher films in plenty of ways <>
ever since scream or even wes cravens earlier new nightmare if you wanna be picky horror films have gone all postmodern on us eschewing grinditout gore in favor of winking recognition of genre conventions <>
urban legends pop culture nuggets range from the acceptably smirky a snippet of the dawsons creek theme played when dawsons creek cast member jackson turns on his car radio to the whocares ridiculous naming one character after one of the films producers and those are only a couple of examples of the strained reaches for gags in silvio hortas script <>
theres just not enough humor or creativity to compensate for the raw terror lost in forced attempts to be cute <>
aside from the effective prologue sequence urban legend misses the boat on providing gutlevel scares <>
{-2} ironically enough it also misses the point that most of the late searly s slasher films these archedeyebrow cousins goof on were actually moralizing cautionary tales just like the ones described by englunds folklore professor <>
when he asks his class if they know the one about the babysitter who gets a call from inside the house many movie fans will say yesit was called when a stranger calls <>
urban legend nicks from the cineliterate horror of scream without even realizing it because movies are our urban legends <>
the film might have been on to something with a killer copycatting other movie murders rather than trying to pass off the everpopular impaled on the parking lot tire spikes tale as part of the collective unconscious or giving us the nanook of the north terror of a killer hidden behind a zippedup parka <>
pity the talented alicia witt late of tvs cybill for getting caught up in a horror film thats not clever enough or scary enough to succeed as anything but a clutchyourdate friday night special <>
urban legend is a tale too often told <>
and as one character in the film says if youre going to tell the story at least get it right <>

[14421/8]
{1} since time immemorial memorial day to be precise one question has plagued moviegoers the world over what might mission impossible have looked like if someone had shown the faintest interest in telling a coherent story <>
as answer i give you ronin an international espionage thriller fueled by as much brain power as adrenaline <>
the comparison to mission impossible is almost too easy especially given the presence of jean reno in both casts but its a telling comparison nonetheless <>
ronin shows how much more effective a film can be when set pieces are connected by ideas <>
{1} the film opens in paris where a man known only as sam robert deniro joins a multinational band of mercenaries employed by irish nationalist deirdre natascha mcelhone <>
vincent jean reno is the teams french location expert gregor stellan skarsgaard oversees electronic surveillance spence sean bean is the weapons specialist larry skipp sudduth serves as their driver <>
their mission is obtaining a certain silver case by any means necessary the contents unknown to the operatives but obviously much in demand <>
as the operation begins alliances quickly shift with the prevailing winds no lofty ideal more important than the exigencies of the moment <>
{1} that notion both drives the film and provides its title <>
as explained in tooliteral especially given a later more subtle explanation onscreen titles ronin is a term for masterless samurai in feudal japan forced to survive as bandits or swordsforhire without the honor of serving a worthy lord <>
sam vincent and company all of whom once served as government agents or soldiers are now downsized cold warriors without a patriotic purpose <>
mission impossible flirted with the same concept but it was to turn characters into vengeancedriven supervillains <>
they function in ronin as free agents loyal only to themselves suspicious and treacherous because everyone around them could be more suspicious or more treacherous <>
the characters are sketched in only the most basic terms in keeping with their private natures yet they are given presence by actors like deniro and reno bringing mournful weight to their performances <>
though few words are spoken in the script by j d zeik and richard weisz aka david mamet the very lack of human interaction between the characters speaks volumes <>
{2} for a fairly introspective film ronin is also a fairly exciting one <>
director john frankenheimer goes to the car chase well perhaps once too often but those he uses are tense and wellconstructed <>
the action level is as high in ronin as it has been in any summer blockbuster of the last few years and its better action more whiteknuckle gripping than whoopitup flashy <>
for some viewers that may be reason enough to spend two hours at the movies but its all the more impressive because the action serves the story <>
every subsequent violent encounter raises the stakes in this chaotic world while its always clear that the combatants neither know nor care what theyre fighting for <>
{1} ronin certainly has its share of jagged edges notably the aforementioned opening titles and a distracting romantic subplot between deniro and mcelhone <>
some may find the characters too remote and underdeveloped and consequently find it difficult to invest emotionally in the story <>
i found the chilly isolation of the characters exactly what i needed to become emotionally invested the emptiness of their lives and actions is the hook <>
this isnt earthshaking profundity were talking about merely the building blocks of effective drama the visceral coupled with the intellectual actions with consequences <>
consequences were never really an issue in mission impossible which makes it that much easier to appreciate what ronin has to offer <>
its no longer a james bond landscape of world domination <>
for once evil in an espionage thriller isnt what people do but why they do it <>

[14358/6]
{0} director carl franklin devil in a blue dress and screenwriter karen croner take a calculated risk in setting up the story for one true thing <>
the framing sequence introduced in the first few minutes finds ellen gulden renee zellweger in a district attorneys office answering questions about the death of her mother kate meryl streep <>
the narrative then proceeds through flashback introducing ellen as a careerminded journalist summoned home by her stern academic father george william hurt to care for kate after she is diagnosed with cancer <>
the risk of course is that knowing the outcome way ahead of time might somehow reduce its emotional impact <>
how effective can a tearjerker be if youre waiting for them to be jerked <>
{1} one true thing deftly sidesteps that problem at least for half its running time by being nothing at all like a conventional tearjerker <>
at its core it tells a story of one of adulthoods most daunting tasks coming to terms with the humanity of ones parents <>
it is clear from the start that ellen is georges daughter she has followed in his footsteps as a writer craves his approval and emulates his disciplined intellectual approach to life <>
kate on the other hand is a slightly embarrassing enigma to her <>
ellen sees kates delight at being a lifelong mother and homemaker as simplemindedness she sees kates sunny optimism as obliviousness <>
spending time with both parents forces ellen to recognize georges hidden weaknesses kates hidden strength and the value understanding both parents can have for her growth <>
{2} as long as the focus remains on those three characters and their relationships one true thing is solid filmmaking <>
meryl streep delivers yet another winning performance finding the warmth and compassion in kate without ever turning her into a cartoon <>
the small mannerisms in her attempts to connect with ellen an almost imperceptible rejected touch hidden disappointment at her daughters dismissals of her are the stuff great screen acting is made of zellweger is nearly as good both in awe of her father and in contempt of her mother while hurt makes good use of the remoteness which has hindered his performances inother films <>
the guldens are a thoroughly recognizable modern family their interactions real enough to evoke emotion and sympathy without resorting to sobs or recriminations <>
theres something particularly wrenching about watching people who love each other trying to like each other <>
{-1} alas the plot device which brought ellen back home soon rears its head and pulls one true thing in the wrong direction <>
its not that the cancer storyline is mawkish or overly manipulative <>
indeed franklins direction and streeps performance avoid most of the traps which can turn such stories into melodrama <>
kates battle with cancer simply occupies too much screen time time which had been so wellspent on kate george and ellen battling with each other <>
once the big c starts taking over the proceedings the nuances of character which had made one true thing such compelling viewing begin to lose their force <>
conversations become confrontations the words sound progressively more scripted and less genuine <>
{-1} a tighter leaner screenplay might have been able to keep ellens journey of discover squarely at the center of one true thing <>
unfortunately screenwriter karen croner handles subplots like ellens unstable relationship with her boyfriend nicky katt and her pursuit of an interview with a scandalridden senator david byron with findthemetaphor urgency <>
theres only one true thing which makes one true thing glow with realism and thats the struggle of parents and their adult children to deal with each other as adults as equals as fellow human beings <>
thats the reason it was so wise to remove the liveordie suspense from a story thats not about who will live or die <>
thats also the reason it was so disappointing to watch the film linger on a foregone conclusion <>

[14287/6]
{0} sometimes i just want to shake a filmmaker who doesnt seem to understand the strengths of her own story <>
take tamara jenkins for example the first time writerdirector behind slums of beverly hills <>
her tale centers around the abramowitz family a semidysfunctional clan living in southern california circa <>
papa murray alan arkin is a noluck car salesman coping with persistent financial shortfalls and being a single parent to his three children most problematic his only daughter yearold vivian natasha lyonne <>
vivian is having enough trouble dealing with typical teenage problems like her suddenly daunting breast size without the added stress of moving from apartment to apartment every few months to stay one step ahead of eviction <>
{1} the mids setting at first seems fairly arbitrary a token attempt at period color but eventually the two main characters deepen the resonance of the time <>
murray the yearold father of three young children is still very much a sstyle father evidenced by a throwaway scene in which he summons a black waiter in a restaurant with a racial slur <>
he defines his success as a father by his ability to provide for his family and makes it his goal to live in an area which will still allow his children to go to the best schools the slums of beverly hills described in the title <>
he certainly cant be the sensitive worldy parent vivian needs as she begins exploring her sexuality in a time light years removed from murrays adolescence <>
how can you discuss sex with a dad who insists that you wear a bra with a halter top <>
{1} that relationship forms the foundation for a solid story where the laughs could have come from simple character interaction <>
the two lead performances are earnest and sympathetic showing a strained affection between father and daughter where communication is a challenge at best <>
lyonne in particular pulls off some difficult scenes of teenage sexual experimentation without a hint of exploitativeness ably assisted by kevin corrigan as the next door neighbor with whom she experiments <>
{-2} why then must jenkins get hyperquirky on us by introducing vivians freespirited older cousin rita marisa tomei a troubled pregnant recovering drug addict who comes to stay with murrays family <>
theres nothing faintly interesting or real about rita or her problems theyre like the shenanigans of a wacky relative on a television sitcom <>
every scene with tomei is an overthetop distraction turning a lowkey character study into forced farce <>
its hard to take slums seriously when a tearful exchange between vivian and rita involves a gobbledegook secret childhood language <>
{-1} its not as though jenkins needed to pad the running time because there wasnt anything more substantial with which to fill it <>
she never quite explains why vivians mother is never discussed never quite explains what happened to the restaurant murray once ran successfully never quite gives fully rounded personalities to vivans two brothers david krumholtz and eli marienthal <>
theres enough going on in that slightly radioactive nuclear famliy to fill a feature film without bringing in crazy cousin rita <>
slums of beverly hills draws you in with some sensitive observations about a family trying to cope with a profound generation gap as well as with a breakout performance by the unconventionally fetching lyonne <>
then it starts pushing you away with gratuitous eccentricity <>
i wish jenkins had showed more faith in murray and vivian <>
like the abramowitzes themselves she doesnt seem to know how good she really has it <>

{0} mike myers transforms himself in in virtually every way a performer can transform himself <>
myers plays steve rubell the nightclub impresario who created the manhattan disco to be the center of the party universe in the closing years of the s <>
rubell presides over his kingdom in a heavylidded barbiturate stupor wheezing a forced monotone cackle as he moves among his glitterati guests <>
in his first truly dramatic screen performance myers is still recognizable with his openmouthed little boy grin but here he uses it to create an overgrown little boy convinced he can only find friends by throwing the coolest party <>
wearing izod shirts and sweaters thinning hair perched pointlessly on top of his head rubell is a protogates portrait of entrepreneurial geekdom <>
if people wont play with him because they like him hell make them play with him because they need him <>
{-1} rubell is a fascinating character performed by myers with a mix of savvy pathos and selfabsorption <>
if writerdirector mark christopher had had the common sense to make the story of steve rubell he might have created a great film <>
instead he makes his protagonist a new jersey kid named shane oshea ryan phillippe who comes to manhattan in to break away from his deadend family <>
he first manages to catch rubells eye and gain entry into the club then lands a job as a busboy eventually moving up the studio social ladder to bartender <>
along the way he befriends another busboy named greg cluelesss breckin meyer and gregs wife aspiring disco diva anita salma hayek <>
he also becomes infatuated with julie black neve campbell a soap opera ingenue whose jerseytothebigtime success story inspired him to action <>
{-2} s baseline narrative is so trite it almost plays like a parody a discoera goof on midnight cowboy or some far less seminal corruption of the innocent melodrama <>
naturally the fame and flash go immediately to shanes head as he poses for modeling shoots and buys a camaro with personalized plates naturally he is lured into a sordid world of sex drugs and money naturally he begins to alienate his friends and family <>
christopher heads down every obvious path in the interactions between shane greg anita and julie apparently oblivious to the fact that every one of those characters is a piece of cardboard <>
perhaps it was his idea of irony like studio itself his movie invites people in so they can stand around and be attractive <>
{-1} the plotting and pacing are so relentlessly predictable that the film doesnt even work well as a sociology lesson <>
occasionally it offers peeks at the side rooms or basement hot spots where the elite meet to revel in their eliteness occasionally it focuses on the politics of succeeding in an environment of glamour for glamours sake <>
shanes voiceover narration dutifully informs us why studio was so unique and popular but theres never enough energy for us to believe him or care <>
spends minutes pointing offhandedly at this or that detail like a bored tour guide <>
for a film that includes moneylaundering ripping off the mob sex drugs celebrities and plenty of boogie oogie oogieing it almost never gets the pulse racing <>
{-1} the notable exceptions are the scenes involving myers as rubell <>
sure the character isnt perfectly realized in fact it probably seems better simply because its surrounded by so much uninspired junk <>
there is something undeniably intriguing about rubell <>
however as his king of the playground glee mingles with selfdestructive anxiety and paranoia <>
its also amusing watching him tell a talk show host the road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom after weve seen him lying in a pile of money drooling vomit <>
theres a great story in that unhappy collection of contradictions but you wont find it amidst the smothering cliches of mark christophers script <>
with all the strangerthanfiction truth at his disposal he somehow found the least interesting approach possible <>
steve rubell would have been disgusted to see studio turned into something somundane <>

{-1} leslie nielsen is leslie nielsen reads a tongueincheek opening credit that opens wrongfully accused and no irony could be more bitter <>
once upon a time nielsen was a bmovie dramatic actor who reinvented himself as a deadpan comedian thanks to the zuckerabrahamszucker team who cast him in airplane and their television series police squad <>
those successes led to three naked gun films based on police squad which in turn led to spy hard and mr magoo <>
the onetime serious actor who used to play straight man so successfully against absurdist parody turned into a selfparody mugging ever more shamelessly as he became typecast as the pratfalling dope <>
{-1} you can expect more of the same leslie nielsen once again as leslie nielsen in wrongfully accused the latest in a seemingly endless string of films this summer from zaz alumni <>
this one written and directed by hot shots and naked gun coscribe pat proft casts nielsen as ryan harrison internationally renowned lord of the violin <>
seduced by a slinky temptress kelly lebrock harrison ends up accused of the murder of millionaire hibbing goodhue michael york looking like a madame tussaud figure of himself <>
he escapes he runs hes pursued by a singleminded lawenforcement agent richard crenna he searches for a onearmed onelegged oneeyed man aaron pearl yada yada yada <>
{-2} i dont know whether the strained comedy of wrongfully accused would have seemed any fresher if it hadnt come hard on the heels of mafia and baseketball but it certainly doesnt help <>
proft tries to keep the gags coming fast enough to obscure the tedium perhaps believing he can convince an audience that a hundred lame jokes add up to one decent one but the gags are worse than uninspired <>
theyre uninspired and redundant the kind of stuff that makes you suspect proft and jim abrahams were sitting in a room together as they were hashing out this film and mafia respectively <>
how else to explain the fact that both films include a shot of a man leaving a lipstick print from a kiss and a computer generated tongue emerging from someones ear and shots at michael flatley <>
{-2} those recycled gags are enough to make wrongfully accused feel ridiculously tired <>
nielsens performance merely compounds the misery <>
he has become such a flashing red light for selfdefeating satire that he simply cant play the role he once played the slackfaced observer of anarchy <>
directors have decided its easier to get the audience to laugh at nielsen than it is to write anything funny to which he can reactor more appropriately not react <>
wrongfully accused features nielsen at his least appealing throwing out rolled eyes grimaces and misguided reaction takes by the truckload <>
instead of providing an incongruous presence that contributes to the humor he becomes a vaguely pathetic aging class clown <>
{-1} i realize that subtlety has never been the forte of genre parody but there are scattered moments when wrongfully accused appears to have a decent idea thats not headsmackingly obvious <>
the best laugh one im sure was unintentional comes from the second cameo by sandra bernhard which belies her prominent featuring in the credits <>
it seems like a clever jab at julianne moores cuttingroomfloor performance in the fugitive especially when nielsen refers to getting information from bernhards character in a scene we never see <>
its probably too much to expect that level of insider satire to be sustained especially when its so much easier to have nielsen bang his head on a low bridge while standing on the bow of the titanic <>
thats about the level of humor you can expect when a films number one comedic weapon is leslie nielsen as leslie nielsen <>

{-1} i know what youre probably thinking about dance with me because its the same thing i was thinking <>
this would be nothing more than a bunch of dance sequences strung together by something that could only be called a plot if you were being particularly generous <>
even the films trailer which featured about a dozen words in two minutes contributed to the impression that dance with me wouldnt be about characters but about plastic windup dance toys masquerading as characters <>
yes the films original title shut up and dance would certainly prove prescient <>
{0} ill tell you what i wasnt expecting one of the years most appealing charismatic performances <>
it comes courtesy of chayanne the puerto rican musical sensation who stars here as rafael infante a young cubano coming to houston texas on a personal mission <>
after landing a job at the studio of dance teacher john burnett kris kristofferson rafael becomes interested in one of the pros who frequents the studio ruby sinclair vanessa l williams <>
ruby is an enigma to rafael since her fierce dedication to dancing doesnt seem to be connected to any real joy <>
as rafael tries to reintroduce ruby to the pure pleasure of dance a tentative romance naturally blossoms between them <>
{-1} simple stuff to be sure perhaps even simplistic but dance with me sells its simplicity almost entirely on the strength of chayannes appeal <>
though its certainly helpful that hes has boyish good looks and an inviting smile his success cant be dismissed as purely hormonal <>
he has to anchor both of the films big emotional hooks tentative attempts to connect with the father he has never known and the romance with williams in spite of a language barrier which he does by acting with his face and body language as well as any young performer of the last several years <>
chayanne has that intangible something called presence something that gets you more involved in a simple story than the material probably deserves <>
{1} that presence is most forceful when he hits the dance floor in an exhilarating sequence at a latin dance club <>
the sequence hinges on rafael conveying to ruby the pure joy of dance and that joy explodes from his every movement <>
as obviously choreographed as some of the spontaneous moves in the club might be its still infectious to watch when rafael seems to be having so much fun <>
he even manages to bring an unforced charm to the gene kelly dance steps he breaks into in the middle of a shower of lawn sprinklers <>
anyone who can invoke singin in the rain without inspiring gasps at the sacrilege has to be doing something right <>
{-1} he does so many things right in fact that the second half of dance with me seems terribly wrongheaded when the focus abruptly shifts to rubys attempts to reignite her career at a las vegas dance competition reunited with her former partner rick valenzuela playing a cartoonish macho egomaniac <>
firsttime screenwriter daryl matthews also the films choreographer makes the mistake of making rubys conflict central at a time in the narrative when theres already plenty of conflict to go around <>
director randa haines meanwhile makes the mistake of spending too much time showing us the competition itself <>
if the point was to prove how much more exciting club dancing is than regimented competitive dancing that point is made and made again for nearly half an hour including ridiculous comic relief from joan plowright as a spunky geriatric <>
the solid chemistry between williams and chayanne is lost the fatherson relationship is buried and the dancing rapidly grows tiresome <>
predictable though the story may have been at least is was energetic <>
dance with me decides to turn into a dance movie exactly when the dancing is least interesting and after the hero has made his impression <>
his charisma makes much of the film watchable until it reaches the point where much to your disappointment they make him and everyone else just shut up and dance <>

{0} in an era when too many films bludgeon you with exposition desperately afraid of leaving anyone behind neil labute says as much with what he refuses to tell you as he does with his words <>
his blistering debut in the company of men explored corporate and interpersonal power games without ever naming the company its product or the city in which it was located <>
in so doing he gave the story an uncomfortable sense of generic familiarity <>
now comes your friends neighbors a tale of the complicated social and sexual dynamics between six urbanites college drama teacher jerry ben stiller his livein girlfriend terri catherine keener he best friend barry aaron eckhart barrys wife mary amy brenneman their womanizing pal cary jason patric and artists assistant cheri nastassja kinski <>
{0} chuckle at the rhyming name conceit if you will but that would only be your most immediate reaction if you saw them in the closing credits <>
youd spend a bit more time puzzling over the realization that not a single one of those names was ever spoken during the film <>
for all the memorable conversations labute gives to his characters your friends neighbors is really about failure in communication a failure at achieving any semblance of intimacy <>
cary prepares for his sexual encounters by rehearsing his pillow talk into a tape recorder terri berates jerry for breaking her concentration by talking during sex barry and mary find themselves unable to talk about their sexual dysfunction problems leading to mary seeking comfort from another man <>
despite the friendship or love which ostensibly is between them these six people treat each other like strangers as though they dont even know each others names <>
{-1} its a premise just as provocative as that of in the company of men but its not executed with quite the same skill <>
in the company of men was an example of clockwork plotting leading a viewer to a powerful conclusion in which everything that preceded it suddenly took on greater resonance <>
your friends neighbors is more pure character study less concerned with where the characters are going than with where they are <>
the few bits of unique composition labute includes specifically a recurring scene in an art gallery where only the characters change are more selfconsciously clever than revelatory <>
as intriguing and often darkly comic as your friends neighbors may be it doesnt entirely satisfy as a narrative <>
its more like a slice of domestic life sliced off with the razor of labutes caustic words altmans short cuts as written by david mamet <>
{0} that still makes your friends neighbors a cut above the competition particularly as a showcase for its cast <>
jason patric sinks his teeth into the showiest role the baldly selfabsorbed cary delivering one monologue about participating in a sexual assault with a frightening tenderness <>
aaron eckhart the callow chad from in the company of men is almost unrecognizable as the paunchy cuckold who believes that he has been his own most satisfying sexual partner <>
the women fare less well with amy brenneman a puzzlement as the unhappy mary but every one of the six principal performers has at least one gripping moment <>
your friends neighbors isnt the icy triumph in the company of men was but it continues neil labutes unflinching unnerving examination of language as assault of every human interaction as a power struggle <>
he says all the things were generally unwilling to admit we sayand sometimes the things we dont say <>

{-2} theres bad buzz and then theres the bad buzz which surrounded the avengers the kind that sounds like a swarm of africanized bees after a particularly vigorous hiveshaking <>
disastrous test screenings it was said had led to a furious round of damage control including multiple reshoots of the ending a release date bumped to the dog days of august and forty minutes axed from the original running time <>
a gratuitous fword had even been added to bump the rating from a pg to pg <>
then all the worst fears seemed to be confirmed when warner bros announced that no advance screenings would be held for the media <>
how fulsome a stink bomb could they be hiding <>
{-1} you may think youre ready for the possibility that a film could be bad but little can prepare you for something as pointless smug and misguided as the avengers <>
like the s british television series of the same name it concerns a dapper secret agent named john steed ralph fiennes partnered by his employers at the ministry with slinky but dangerous mrs emma peel uma thurman to protect the world from evil <>
evil in this case takes the form of sir august dewynter sean connery a disgruntled former government worker who now can control the worlds weather <>
thus is is up to steed and peel to save the world from meteorological extortion whenever they have time between rounds of calculated badinage <>
{-1} it is the latter which proves most instantly and consistently grating in the avengers ralph fiennes and uma thurman spend most of their scenes together engaging in a smirk throwing contest each one trying to look the most amused with him or herself eyebrows so prominently arched youre afraid someone might sprain something <>
this despite the fact that don macphersons dialogue is a study in witlessness tossing out embarrassing puns as though they were saucy enough to turn oscar wilde green with envy <>
though they generally appear content to let their wardrobe do most of the acting for them fiennes and thurman should be commended for one impressive demonstration of dramatic skill theyre able to treat the most mundane comments as though they were nuggets of pure comic gold bestowed upon the world <>
{-2} that kind of quipheavy selfawareness was certainly true of the namesake television series as well so whats so wrong with this variation on the theme <>
in short both the personnel and the context <>
patrick macnee and diana rigg the most celebrated of the series pairings shared a genuine chemistry which made the romantic tension fun to watch <>
fiennes and thurman appear far too enamored of their own charm and cleverness to bother connecting with one another <>
theyre also dropped into a summer blockbuster milieu entirely inappropriate for lighthearted capering <>
imagine an episode of the old batman series with a million budget and youll understand whats so wrong with the avengers <>
its hard to endear yourself to an audience with lowtech campiness at the same time youre blowing something up every minutes or sending huge mechanical insects after our heroes like something out of the speeder bike chase from return of the jedi <>
{-2} were long past the point of pretending that plot or character has anything to do with smodel hollywood summer fare so i wont even bother slapping the avengers around for exhibiting symptoms of that particular contagious disease <>
but such a film has to give you something to latch on to engaging performers effective pacing a decent villain to hiss <>
not even sean connery blustering about without the faintest idea why his character does anything can pump up the charisma quotient of this tedious car wreck of a film <>
the closest recent analog to the avengers is batman and robin but at least batman and robin had its sheer momenteum and comicbook gaudiness to salvage it <>
the avengers is just action sequences in search of a movie actors in search of a reason to keep smirking <>
crimes against film audiences must be avenged the buzz of surly patrons coming out of the theater may be even more frightening than the buzz on the film <>

{-1} a lesson in shortterm benefit vs longterm detriment courtesy of screenwriters ron bass and terry mcmillan in the course of adapting mcmillans novel how stella got her groove back the pair make a decision which gives the first half a real kick then kicks the second half into oblivion <>
the heroine of the title is stella payne angela bassett a yearold san francisco investment banker with a gorgeous house an yearold son michael j pagan an exhusband and no man in her life <>
itching for a change of pace while her son is visiting his father stella calls up her new yorkbased best pal delilah whoopi goldberg and suggests a weeklong vacation in jamaica <>
stella expects little more than an uncomplicated island holiday but instead finds complications galore when she falls for yearold winston shakespeare taye diggs and he in turn falls for her <>
{1} the significant change involves stellas companion on her jamaican adventure <>
in mcmillans novel delilah does not join stella on her trip in fact stellas lifelong best friend is nearly two years dead <>
adding delilah to the mix certainly adds some spice to the secondchance romance story line particularly with goldberg in the role <>
sure goldberg is doing little more than an extended funkysassy miss thang riff but shes always fun to watch timing her salacious or sarcastic comments impeccably <>
initially it looks like a brilliant idea to give the staid stella a freespirited foil <>
instead of the novels hyperintrospective first person narrative stella on screen offers a bit more interplay and a bit more fun <>
{-1} so much for the shortterm benefit <>
the problem as it turns out is that delilah is phased out of the story fairly early on leaving an energy vacuum for regina king as stellas hopelessly irresponsible sister to fill with only moderate success <>
were left with stella fussing and fretting over the age difference between her and winston and were left with a lot more questions regarding why stella does what she does <>
delilahs absence in the novel becomes part of stellas loneliness helping explain both her initial attraction to anyone who would fill the void and her doubts over how serious the relationship could possibly be <>
as talented and forceful an actor as angela bassett can be she plays stella with too much exuberant confidence <>
delilahs influence is pervasive as the relationship blossoms the bumpngrind stella we see in jamaica appears to have far too much groove still in her to need getting any of it back <>
{-2} the combination of unfocused motivations and little comic relief proves fatal in the films final minutes when it becomes a genuine buttnumbing ordeal <>
the story simply has nowhere left to go but around in circles theres some relationship talk a bit of romance tense moments and more relationship talk all of it surrounding a relationship with not nearly enough chemistry to be involving <>
newcomer taye diggs doing a barely serviceable jamaican accent has all the boyish charm the role needs with about a tenth of the maturebeyondhisyears wisdom it requires <>
that leaves a whole lot of grating willtheyorwontthey vacillation over a pairing that on screen doesnt make much sense <>
{-1} bass and mcmillan seemed to realize that the very internalized nature of how stella got her groove back required something different to work as a film <>
the big change they made had it heading in the right direction but it only emphasized how truly uncinematic the rest of the story could be <>
whoopi goldberg may chew up the lovely island scenery but at least she presents something worth holding your attention for an hour or so <>
she also makes the rest of the film look like its about a different kind of groove the runout groove <>

[13841/4]
{-1} quite a few things have changed since last we visited with buddy the hoopsshooting golden retriever star of air bud <>
his human pal josh framm kevin zegers is starting junior high school joshs widowed mother cynthia stevenson taking over from wendy makkena is reentering the dating arena <>
even the name before the film has changed with disney shuttling the sequel from its flagship banner to dimension the genre division of miramax apparently realizing the original had too few fart jokes to qualify as a liveaction disney film <>
and of course the most significant and tragic change involved the death of the original buddy from cancer though he was only one of several dogs to perform in air bud <>
{-1} i only wish that with all those changes they could have rustled up a new screenwriting team <>
paul tamasy and aaron mendelsohn return to duty for air bud golden receiver this time turning buddy into a football star when josh goes out for the local hapless youth football team led by goodnatured multiplebypasswaitingtohappen coach fanelli robert costanzo <>
naturally this leads to amusing sequences of buddy befuddling opposing defenses as he makes like jerry rice <>
but wait theres more <>
you also get touching dramatic subtext as josh struggles to accept his moms new relationship with a kindly veterinarian gregory harrison <>
all that plus a bumbling pair of russians nora dunn and perry anzilotti who want to kidnap buddy to join their trained animal circus <>
{-2} the original air bud had good intentions and solid family values to spare but it tied them up in such derivative and unfocused package that even the kids in the audience couldnt keep their attention on the precocious pooch <>
new director richard martin picks up the pace considerably this time around but he cant do much to create any cohesiveness with this story <>
from moment to moment its hard to tell whether air bud golden receiver is supposed to be an afterschool special a john hughes film or an episode of rocky and bullwinkle though with considerably less wit <>
martin even throws in some lowrent vaudeville by pairing his own dad dick of rowan martin fame with tim conway as goofy playbyplay announcers <>
its hard to take the messages about believing in yourself and loving a new parent seriously when theyre juxtaposed with two clowns sliding around in the contents of a tank conveniently labeled fish guts <>
{-2} its also hard to take seriously a film where a premise so bizarre is shrugged off as a given <>
to the credit of the original air bud at least it showed people fumbling with the basketball rule book to figure out whether a dog was eligible for the team <>
this time around buddy trots onto the field in his leather helmet and shoulder pads as though it were the most natural thing in the world <>
perhaps somewhere on the cutting room floor is a scene in which an arbitrator cites the air bud precedent <>
without such a scene everything that follows seems a little insulting to the intelligence and an indication of how lazy the screenwriters were that they couldnt come up with some creative way to land buddy on the team <>
isnt it about time for a satiric poke at school inclusiveness rules <>
{-2} im not pretending that air bud golden receiver was made with me in mind <>
this one is a short attention span kiddiecaper which did have the young ones clapping and guffawing with some regularity and perhaps that counts for something <>
it even features a few decent throwaway gags including a llama named dolly and a splendidly offkey rendition of the american national anthem <>
theres just something vaguely desperate about this whole air bud franchise they have build not just one film but a series of them on what amounts to a betterthanaverage stupid pet trick <>
sure its harmless enough but the frantic amalgamation of disparate elements gave me a headache <>
its a bit frightening to note that the original buddys trainer kevin dicicco is putting together another project air bud the next generation <>
perhaps in the course of teaching a new dog a new trick he could teach a new screenwriting team one id really love to see how to write a script that might appeal to someone over the age of five <>

{0} it was years ago that teenage babysitter laurie strode jamie lee curtis and her longinstitutionalized homicidal brother michael myers took sibling squabbling to a new plateau one involving cutlery and the creative use of wire hangers <>
the film was john carpenters halloween a lowbudget phenomenon which launched the muchloathed but immensely profitable teen slasher genre <>
masked andor mutilated maniacs proliferated the numbers on the sequels clicking by faster than the number of customers served by mcdonalds <>
its no wonder dimension films tagged the subtitle twenty years later on halloween h they probably feared viewers would actually think this was the th film in the series <>
{0} this sequel of course is banking on something a bit more than name recognition to draw viewers nostalgia <>
after nearly two decades including the sequel halloween jamie lee curtis returns to the role that made her famous showing us how effectively laurie strode recovered from that one traumatic halloween night namely not at all <>
living under an assumed name as the headmistress of a california private school laurie is a walking psychological disaster area <>
behind her are an abusive marriage and years of therapy still with her are an alcohol problem a prescription drug problem recurring nightmares and a paralyzing fear of letting her teenage son john josh hartnett out of her sight <>
if youve ever wondered what surviving the carnage of a teen slasher movie would do to someone heres your answer <>
{1} that effective bit of back story carries halloween h over the pitfalls of genre convention which even executive producer kevin williamson the postmodernist horror connoisseur behind scream and scream cant quite shake off <>
the events begin with michael raiding the files of the late dr loomis the late donald pleasance to whom the film is dedicated to find lauries new identity though why he would demonstrate the grand sense of theater to wait until the th anniversary is never quite clear <>
from there he proceeds to make his way west reserving most of his wrath for the libidinous in keeping with the fine sexequalsdeath tradition of slasher filmmaking <>
blood is spilled startling musical cues accompany every movement into frame by the most innocuous character and kitchen implements are used contrary to the safety instructions <>
{1} the one thing williamson and director steve miner do bring to the proceedings is a bit more understated menace <>
surprisingly every encounter between michael and an unfortunate stranger does not result in an impromptu ginzu aeration <>
the threat of impending death is sometimes used strictly as a threat raising the stakes of every subsequent encounter because you know its possible to survive <>
this killers singularity of purpose combined with some wellcrafted setpieces allows this halloween to score more points with tension than it does with shock value <>
{1} clearly it also scores on the basis of its climactic showdown <>
though hartnett michelle williams and jodi lyn okeefe are on hand for teen hormone value curtis is unquestionably the star of this show <>
lauries resourcefulness in the original halloween made her an uncommon screen heroine and the same quality is present this time around <>
she goes into battle armed not just with an axe but with twenty years of history and a convincing grim determination <>
its actually here that williamsons sensibility shows through most obviously playing on genre expectations halloween h shows laurie not trusting anything as mundane as a body bag to guarantee that michael wont be back to continue tormenting her in halloween h <>
the return of laurie strode could have been a cheap publicity stunt <>
instead its a genuinely effective recognition of the originals influence <>
though too conventional to be truly thrilling halloween h is a fitting final round for one of screen historys bloodiest family feuds <>

{-1} if your comic tastes run to the urbane this is most definitely the summer of your discontent <>
theres something about mary brought you mangled genitalia and dangling bodily fluids mafia featured flaming flatulence and a boy being smuggled in a donkeys rectum <>
and now comes baseketball cowritten and directed by david zucker the naked gun and starring trey parker and matt stone the creators of south park who gave the world a talking piece of excrement named mr hankey <>
anyone want to place bets on whether its going to be an oscar wildeian romp spilling over with tres bon mots <>
{-1} fact is baseketball tosses off the kind of groinlevel humor that makes theres something about mary look like a particularly droll new yorker cartoon <>
this tale of two losers parker and stone who create a sports sensation combining elements of baseball and basketball scurries about in search of every imaginable source of vulgar offensive andor just plain immature comedy <>
stone lactates like a parisian fountain parker slurps liposuctioned fat from a plastic bag both stars sport prosthetic male members which make it look like theyre auditioning for the sequel to boogie nights <>
no subject is too sensitive for some sort of peurile gag not gays not foreign accents not raving bigots not necrophilia <>
{1} damn them all for making it funny too often to dismiss <>
yes baseketball certainly crosses the line at times from daring to meanspirited <>
it also includes some wicked shots at professional sports from corporate stadium sponsorship to peripatetic franchises to bizarre promotional giveaways including dozen egg night free range chicken night and anal probe night <>
the best running gag comes from the baseketball rule which allows opponent to taunt the player with the ball in an effort to psych him out <>
stone and parker take the opportunity to run with every possible distracting comment gesture and visual image <>
theres nowhere too low for them to sink and they get enough laughs to justify going just a bit lower the next time <>
{-1} its hard to tell whether parker and stone have the stuff to be legitimate big screen comic stars <>
baseketball is an ideal showcase for their malicious dudespewing wastrel characters theyre like bill and ted with more acid in their veins <>
still theres a sense that theyre just the slightest bit desperate to impress too eager to reach for a fourletter punch line before coming up with a more clever alternative <>
when parker finally goes for a laugh by trotting out the voice of south parks eric cartman you can bet the audience will go wild with recognition <>
it just feels lazy one overgrown adolescent playing to other overgrown adolescents congratulating himself for being the id boy of the moment <>
{1} strange as it may seem david zucker ends up being the steadying influence which reins in parker and stone <>
zucker knows how to play a nearsubliminal visual joke with the best of them and he works in plenty of kneeslappers in baseketball <>
he also calls on airplane alums kareem abduljabbar and robert stack to help out with stack doing a particularly hilarious parody of his own gig hosting unsolved mysteries <>
even when he steals from himself in the character of a sick boy at the mercy of idiots a la jill whelan in airplane he gives it a fresh twist theres nothing quite like watching an yearold in need of a liver transplant doing rounds of tequila shots <>
thats one of the tamer bits in baseketball a film that sometimes doesnt know when to quit <>
there will be viewers who revel in that sort of look at me ma im being irreverent irreverence <>
others will shake their heads at the continuation of their comedic summer of discontent even through their own embarrassed giggles <>

{0} there are probably equal reasons to fear for the worst and hope for the best in considering a remake of disneys film the parent trap <>
on the one hand you have disneys recent track record plundering its own vaults for tiresome frantic updates like dalmatians that darn cat and flubber <>
on the other hand you have the filmmaking team of charles shyer and nancy meyers who infuriated purists by daring to remake father of the bride then turned out a thoroughly charming fatherdaughter relationship story which in some ways improved on the original martin shorts overthetop franckophone notwithstanding <>
which would rule s disney scatalogymongering or shyermeyers restraint and family appeal <>
{1} its a pleasure to report that the model of the parent trap offers far more of the latter than the former though its far from an unqualified success <>
the story again concerns two young twins california girl hallie parker and londoner annie james both played by lindsay lohan who never knew of each others existence until they meet at a new england summer camp <>
it seems that their parents nick dennis quaid and elizabeth natasha richardson impulsively married then impulsively divorced years earlier dividing everything down the middle incuding their children <>
with each one intrigued by the prospect of meeting the parent she has never known as well as the prospect of bringing nick and elizabeth together again the two girls decide to switch places when returning home from camp <>
there turns out to be one major snag in the plan however nicks new fiancee meredith elaine hendrix a golddigging manipulator who spells nothing but trouble <>
{1} whats most right about the parent trap is that it avoids what has been most wrong about other recent disney remakes <>
from the opening credits sequence which depicts nick and elizabeths whirlwind marriage to the tune of nat king coles love the parent trap seems to have a modicum of class and an interest in telling a story without explosions or flatulence <>
there are some highspirited pranks as the girls compete at camp and a bit of slapstick during a camping trip but mostly its just a pleasant amusing diversion that could have been made years ago like the original <>
a highconcept premise rarely feels this lowconcept <>
{2} the one thing it couldnt have had thirty years ago is yearold lindsay lohan the films captivating star <>
child actors are trouble enough and child actors in their first feature film even more so but lohans goodnatured sweetness is infectious <>
she even adopts a quite serviceable english accent which should make more veteran actors are you listening kevin costner hang their heads in shame <>
lohan is just part of a solid cast including hendrix as a juicy villainess and lisa ann walter as nicks acerbic housekeeper which gives the story plenty of humor and warmth <>
and its a nice touch to see joanna barnes reprising her character from the original parent trap in the appropriate role of merediths mother <>
{0} as is the case with most remakes its tough to argue that the parent trap was crying out for a contemporary retelling <>
this version brings nothing revolutionary to the table drags through some sluggish spots in its two hour running time and never really builds much chemistry between quaid and richardson <>
most disappointing is the climactic camping trip where the twins torment the hapless city girl meredith the sequence is too short the editing too choppy and the resolution far too abrupt <>
the parent trap is basically the kind of film usually described with a dismissive word like cute which is certainly accurate enough <>
cute films are becoming harder and harder to find however and this one keeps things light enough to sidestep any of shyer and meyers more saccharine impulses <>
every once in a while uncomplicated and inoffensive fun feels just right <>

{-1} a message to all you aspiring screenwriters know your genre <>
ont misunderstand im not suggesting a writer should limit him or herself to only one genre or that film script formulas couldnt stand a little innovation <>
however there are good reasons why you shouldnt write a farce the same way you write a biographical drama <>
its about pacing about knowing your audience about delivering the emotions the genre promises to deliver <>
scott rosenberg has made a decent career for himself writing primarily comedies beautiful girls and action films con air uncredited contribution to armageddon <>
his chosen style is arch dialogue and lots of it which works out just fine when youre writing a comedy or an action film <>
a dark thriller is another cinematic beastie entirely <>
in the case of disturbing behavior that critter is a great big turkey <>
{0} it didnt necessarily have to be so foul a fowl <>
the premise is a degree spin on ira levins the stepford wives the tale of a troubled teen named steve clark james marsden trying to adjust to his new home of cradle bay washington after a family tragedy <>
but theres something strange going on among the teens of cradle bay something stoner gavin strick nick stahl tries to warn steve about a group of frighteningly civicminded students called the blue ribbons <>
you see when theyre not holding bake sales theyre breaking the necks of their girlfriends and recruiting other students into a state of lobotomized pleasantness <>
{-1} its a nifty idea to create a creepshow out of the recognition that a teenager whos acting normal probably isnt <>
disturbing behavior however isnt really a creepshow <>
instead its a frantic and unfocused teensploitation in which the reprogrammed adolescents get violent when they get horny which being teenagers they do with some regularity <>
xfiles and millennium veteran david nutter drags out plenty of familiar tricks pointofview camera tricks bobbing flashlights in the woods even a score by mark snow but his efforts to create mood cant get past whocares characterizations and unexplained motivations <>
theres nothing frightening about the mastermind behind the plot since hes just another one of the malicious or oblivious adults who populate films of this kind <>
the notable exception is the wacky janitor william sadler who hangs out in the high school basement killing rats <>
score one for the parents of cradle bay for being more concerned with rebellious attire than with a rodentobsessed lunatic working in their childrens school <>
{-2} ultimately disturbing behavior crashes on the failure of rosenbergs script <>
leave aside for a moment the perfunctory romantic interest katie holmes the forced dialogue like selfmutilate this fluid boy or the pointless extended riff in which gavin hips steve to the startling revelation that gasp high school students form cliques <>
disturbing behavior is simply a miserable thriller because rosenberg rarely bothers to build any tension into his scenes <>
sure he has people jump out to go boogabooga every once in a while <>
that doesnt add up to a second of genuine suspense even when our heroes find themselves the next candidates for clockwork orange style treatment <>
the film merely tears along from start to finish in a brisk minutes and when its all said and done the only thing youll remember is how ridiculous it all is <>
{-2} disturbing behavior isnt a lousy thriller because it tries to be funny <>
the xfiles has successfully paired satire and scares as have the two scream films <>
it helps however if the humor supports character development or perhaps elicits a laugh once in a while all right the blue ribbons olivia newtonjohnplaying yogurt shop hangout is worth a chuckle <>
no disturbing behavior is a lousy thriller because it never tries to be thrilling <>
its just a big dumb goof cynically pitched at youth with sex violence loud music and a story that doesnt make a shred of sense <>
having made two recent films with michael bay rosenbergs mistake is understandable <>
but if youre going to write an action film youd better not try to make it a suspense film <>
the idea of scott rosenbergs next thriller if he doesnt learn a few new tricksnow thats scary <>

{0} some films are so baldfaced in their attempt to have it both ways that you just have to hand it to em for their chutzpah <>
on one level for instance its obvious small soldiers wants to skewer gungho militarism <>
the setup finds defense contractor globotech purchasing a toy company with the cheerfully allamerican name of heartland attempting to diversify before postcold war downsizing downsizes it right out of existence <>
instructed by globotech boss gil mars denis leary to create stateoftheart action toys designer larry benson jay mohr slips a prototype weapons system microprocessor into the new commando elite and gorgonite action figure lines creating intelligent interactive toys designed with the same rigorous standards demanded by the us defense department perhaps the films best joke <>
{0} the kicker is that the commando elite figures led by chip hazard voice of tommy lee jones are the merciless and vaguely racist bad guys programmed to seek out and destroy the gentle noble homeseeking archer frank langella and his insecure fellow gorgonites no one explains why the gorgonites couldnt have been programmed as slightly more challenging antagonists than the therapy group from the bob newhart show <>
when troubled teen alan abernathy gregory smith allies himself with the gorgonites he too becomes a commando target along with his new agey parents kevin dunn and ann magnuson and his wouldbe girlfriend christy kirsten dunst <>
as chip rallies his troops against the enemy framed pattonlike by the us flag and spouting a succession of nonsequitur patriotic cliches it becomes clear that director joe dante and his team of writers want us to nod knowingly at how the destruction to come will be the result of hardwired hyperhawkishness <>
{-2} those same folks also know that the destruction to come will be considered bitchin cool by a contingent in the audience which might be inclined to by small soldiers merchandise <>
in an era where action figure tieins are as much a part of popcorn moviemaking as plastic fast food cups small soldiers bypasses the inconvenient middle step of figuring out how to turn the characters into toys <>
it also bypasses the inconvenient middle step of explaining why we should side with the peaceloving gorgonites when the film makes the commando elites assault complete with flaming tennis balls nail guns and makeshift helicopters look like so much fun <>
in many of his previous films including gremlins which is the most obvious model for small soldiers dante was able to give a dark edge to his invasions of suburban serenity <>
he loses that edge early on in small soldiers to meet the demands of marketing <>
its almost as though the checks mars the god of war get it passes out to every one at the end to buy their silence bought off the filmmakers as well <>
{1} it would be easier to dismiss small soldiers if the result werent so entertaining not to mention frequently amusing <>
for adults it will be clever mostly in an injokey sort of way from references to gremlins gizmo to the use of heman icons like ernest borgnine george kennedy and clint walker as voices for the commando elite <>
the rest of the voice talent spinal tap alums christopher guest michael mckean and harry shearer reunited as gorgonites sarah michelle gellar and christina ricci voicing mutant versions of a barbiestyle doll isnt too shabby either <>
the humans may be a pretty boring lot excluding phil hartman in his last film role as christys consumer electronicsobsessed dad but the combination of stan winstons animatronics and perfectlyintegrated cgi versions make the toy story a fairly lively one <>
{1} small soldiers is just weird and twisted enough to be worth a matinee <>
its also a poorlyconcealed version of the same action worship you find in a film like armageddon though its almost better when the worship is thoroughly unironic <>
the token attempts at satire notwithstanding small soldiers plays most like a juicedup featurelength commercial for real commando elite action figures available now at a store near you <>

{-1} you gotta give bonus points to the touchstone pictures publicity department for uncommon candor on the subject of bigbudget film screenwriting <>
press materials for armageddon proudly trumpet the fact that the producers assembled a cadre of talented writers to polish up jonathan hensleighs script including tony gilroy paul attanasio scott rosenbert and robert towne <>
even cast members steve buscemi peter stormare and owen wilson were acknowledged for their adlib contributions <>
after creating an additional writing credit to accommodate two more names adaptation on top of story and screenplay as if you could figure out the difference jerry bruckheimer and touchstone appear to have publicly embraced the concept of potluck screenwriting the notion that if a dozen different guys all bring something to the table you end up with a cinematic meal <>

the subject of course is this summers favorite a huge celestial body on a collision course with our big blue marble this one an asteroid the size of texas <>
faced with a global killer certain to wipe out life as we know it nasa chief dan truman billy bob thornton initiates a plan involving landing a shuttle on the asteroid and planting a nuclear warhead feet below its surface <>
to that end he recruits deepcore oil driller harry stamper bruce willis for the job of making the big hole for the big bomb <>
naturally harry needs his misfit crew along with him including hotshot a j ben affleck who coincidentally is in love with harrys daughter grace liv tyler much to harrys paternal consternation <>
{1} its enough to generate flashbacks from deep impact where the feeble attempts to generate sweeping emotion more often generated sleeping emotion <>

director michael bay predictably resorts to tensionbuilders like close shaves with countdown clocks but at least he knows enough to keep the focus on the drill teams mission once theyre in space <>
for its final minutes armageddon is virtually nothing but explosions crashes and narrow escapesand thats a good thing <>

stock interpersonal conflicts share time with tender moments as all involved make their peace before heading off to save humanity im not sure whether i was more moved by the gruff reconciliation between grace and harry or a j wooing grace using animal crackers for foreplay dont ask <>
its all a load of nonsense made even less interesting by bays foolish decision to keep chopping back and forth between the playful introduction of our roughneck protagonists and a solemn war room session at nasa <>
theres nothing cohesive or compelling about armageddon as narrative strangely enough it feels like the result of a dozen different writers contributing individual scenes or lines of dialogue <>
{1} im not going to suggest that armageddon isnt a pretty effective diversion <>
if theres one thing a dozen writers can do its produce a bunch of solid laughs and craft a few exciting action sequences <>
its fun watching the unhinged performances of buscemi as the crews horny geologist and his fargo partner stormare as a loopy cosmonaut and its fun grinning at creaky devices like military men being turned into villains for choosing the fate of all humanity over our intrepid heroes <>
theres just not much more you can expect from a film where they seem more interested in throwing in a godzilla gag than in letting one writer create an actual story <>
for all the uneven visceral enjoyment that its worth touchstone pictures proudly presents armageddon a blockbuster a la carte <>

{-2} if hollywood is going to insist on making awful films the least it could do is make them as wonderfully hilariously awful as wild things <>
there is a kind of zen preposterousness certain films achieve oh lets use showgirls as an example which makes them too much fun to dismiss <>
they become impromptu mystery science theater experiences where you find yourself hooting and commenting throughout the ridiculous situations plasterofparis acting and quotably appalling dialogue <>
{-2} im not entirely sure that wild things isnt a huge selfaware joke attempting to combine the joe eszterhas oeuvre showgirls basic instinct jade and gradez exploitation films bursting with busty women in the swamps <>
the plot begins with a south florida high school guidance counselor named sam lombardo matt dillon who finds himself accused of rape by two of his students pouty flirtatious richgirl cheerleader kelly denise richards and wrongsideofthetracks tattooed potsmoking troublemaker susie neve campbell <>

the same kind of perverse ionlyreaditforthearticles voyeurism which finds otherwise sensible people pausing when they flip past jerry springer could have you shaking your head and giggling nonstop <>
in fact the pseudoserious but scandalgrubbing television coverage of lombardos trial in wild things serves as an apt metaphor for what we should be expecting from the film <>
theres no way to take wild things seriously as a movie any more than its possible to take melrose place seriously as topical drama or hard copy seriously as journalism <>
its a lowestcommondenominator side show of all the stuff we mock with kneejerk superiority yet still manages to do gangbuster ratings <>
{-1} it is only a tremendously entertaining supporting turn by bill murray which makes it hard to forgive wild things all its trespasses <>
as lombardos ambulancechasing attorney murray brings a genuine comic touch to the proceedings one which doesnt force you to stop laughing to figure out whether the humor is intentional <>
when murrays loose confident work exists alongside the hamfisted conniving of kellys nasty mother theresa russell and a smug member of the town elite robert wagner any possible sense of planned parody vanishes <>
even the films extended closing credits coda which backtracks to explain how all the plotting comes together feels like a huge miscalculation <>
if it matters that much whether or not the plot makes sense then wild things really is that bad <>
{-2} perhaps its just the eternal optimist in me which makes me want to believe there was a logic behind the perverse inanity or perhaps thats inane perversity of wild things <>
or perhaps its the need to find a reason why id rather sit through a film as bad as wild things again before id sit through a better film like twilight <>
i cant even call it a guilty pleasure because its not the film i enjoyed <>

wallace effectively combined vengeance romance and adventure in his script for braveheart but in his first film behind the camera he never seems clear how to unite all the elements he introduces <>

half the cast speaks with french accents all genuine courtesy depardieu anne parillaud and plasticine ingenue judith godreche while the other half appears to have wandered in from malibu or london or dublin <>
given the chance to bite into louis xivs nastiness with relish dicaprio instead gives him a tiresome method twist which suggests he just wants to be loved <>
and who is peter sarsgaard playing the son of aramis and has anyone ever done a more frighteningly deadon impression of john malkovich <>
{-2} all might have been forgiven if only wallace had played the musketeer trump card for all it was worth <>
hes got viewers right where he wants them with such iconic characters at his disposal the good will is as palpable as it is at a james bond film where the mere utterance of a trademark phrase generates a ripple of excitement <>
theres just no good excuse to waste that kind of good will on one or two rounds of lackluster swordplay <>
dumas wrote wonderful pulp wallace tries to turn that pulp into something its not only hes not exactly sure what that is <>
the man in the iron mask is a big muddled mess of an adventure yarn satisfying only for those interested in going to watch dicaprio in regal finery looking his prettiest <>
others will find a waste of stellar cast and classic story which never gets a handle on what the film should have been about for the average viewer a chance to cheer for the crossed swords of reborn legends just a bit earlier than minutes after the lights go down <>

while the grinding predictability of most american films challenges a writer to generate one more coherent thought than the film itself coen efforts like millers crossing barton fink and fargo burst from the screen like doctoral theses waiting to be written sending cinema scribes scrambling gleefully for a thesaurus <>

{-1} it was so much fun deconstructing the big lebowski after the fact that i started trying to convince myself i had had as much fun watching it <>
the reason its not more fun despite a blissful singularity of vision which always keeps you watching is that the coens seem to take the same approach to making their films that we critics take to analyzing them <>
theyre not stories as much as they are intellectual and aesthetic calistheics films which make you work hard enough that you have to convince yourself youre getting something out of them <>
joel and ethans encyclopedic knowledge of genre conventions and film expectations allow them to understand exactly when to yank the rug but in the big lebowski they fall into the same trap which hampered the hudsucker proxy they create so much distance from the characters that youre left with congratulating yourself because you got the joke <>

{-2} some scattered thoughts on kissing a fool a film too aggressively mediocre to permit much more <>
{-1} memo to david schwimmer and jason lee its nice to see that you wanted to stretch a bit and try changeofpace roles now quit it <>
in kissing a fool schwimmer plays a womanizing sportscaster named max abbitt who thinks he has finally found the one in editor samantha andrews mili avital lee plays maxs best friend jay murphy a sensitive writer who has spent a year moping over the end of a relationship while turning it into his first novel <>
the premise finds sensitive jay struggling with insecure maxs request that he test samanthas fidelity by trying to seduce her leading to all sorts of wild hijinks <>
{-1} that is assuming you are willing to suspend your disbelief from the rafters long enough to buy the puppydog schwimmer as an irresistable sex machine or lee the abrasive banky in chasing amy as mr nice guy <>
schwimmers rendition of machismo consists of using a certain fourletter explitive around forty times while lee seems to be comfortable only when hes yelling at somebody though he can be very funny when he is yelling at somebody <>
both try so hard to create their own respective antiimage that they dont create actual characters <>
{1} memo to the american moviegoing public make bonnie hunt a star or else <>
hunt who plays jays publisher and narrates the film in flashback is simply one of the funniest women in any medium bringing life to otherwise lifeless films like only you or jumanji <>
in kissing a fool i kept waiting for the action to switch back to hunt telling the tale to a couple of annoying party guests where her unmatched reaction shots could provide all the zing the script lacked <>
sadly no one seems willing to give hunt a chance to carry a film which means shes generally relegated to mopup duty in supporting roles <>
until we all rise up and demand a better showcase for this wonderful performer well all have to sit through films like kissing a fool in order to see her <>
{-1} memo to screenwriters of mainstream romantic comedies enough with the coy pretext that everyone in the audience doesnt know exactly how the story is going to end <>
the flashback framing structure of kissing a fool teases us by not showing us the groom to whom samantha is getting married but i mean really <>
the setup is so transparently headed in one direction that its insulting to suggest that anyone would guess incorrectly not to mention the small fact that hunts character makes it explicitly clear with one comment <>

{0} a little over an hour into dark city three of the films central characters sit in a small boat rowing slowly through a canal <>
john murdoch rufus sewell is a man who wakes up one night to find himself a suspect in a series of murders though he has no memory of his past detective bumstead william hurt is the officer investigating the crimes dr daniel screber kiefer sutherland is a mysterious psychiatrist <>
as they row row row their boat schreber explains in detail how he was forced to serve a group of sinister nattilydressed extraterrestrials known as the strangers <>
through the use of their awesome power to manipulate reality called tuning the strangers have constructed an artificial city as a massive test environment playing with the lives and memories of human subjects to discover what makes them human <>
only murdoch whose own nascent tuning abilities allow him to block the strangers control can help free the dark city from its dark overlords <>
{-2} sutherland prattles on with his plot summary for around five minutes his wheezing mannered peter lorremeetsthe elephant man delivery growing more insufferable by the moment his character rapidly becoming something akin to austin powers sir basil exposition <>
its the sort of lazy aggravating scene which is all too common in sciencefictionfantasy films but in dark city its even more aggravating <>
you see sutherlands interminable synopsis consists of three distinct subcategories stuff already explicitly stated in the equally lazy opening narration stuff which should have been painfully easy to show rather than tell stuff a viewer should have been able to figure out by actually watching the preceding hour instead of waiting for someone to give him the gist of it <>
{-1} and therein one can spot why its a bad idea to take a dark existential thriller and pitch it at yearolds <>
director and cowriter alex proyas the crow begins with several intriguing ideas the nature of identity love as present experience versus collected experience modern paranoia about loss of control but he seems so afraid of losing his audience that he keeps slowing down to allow the stragglers to catch up <>
every time dark city begins building towards a sense of mystery or menace a convenient prosaic bit of dialogue breaks the spell to start spelling everything out <>
when proyas isnt afraid of losing his audience hes afraid of boring them which means that the climax of his psychological study becomes a ridiculously chaotic battle in which sewell and veteran british actor ian richardson as the strangers leader go at it like karloff and price in the raven staring each other down as waves of psychic energy unfortunately bystanding strangers and clouds of debris swirl around them <>
{-1} i cant even work up much enthusiasm for the look of dark city with its pale bald antagonists and a few morphing twists added to the bleakchic cityscapes of modern sciencefantasy <>
despite its brief flirtations with profound philosophical questions its really just another goodlooking vessel in which a cast of secondtier stars sutherland jennifer connelly and slumming serious actors sewell richardson hurt is asked to rattle around for minutes until the special effects budget runs out <>
it didnt necessarily have to be like that not with a provocative premise as promising as that of blade runner <>
it simply takes guts to let a premise like that play itself out the kind of guts studio executives generally dont have <>
i wouldnt be surprised to find out that word came down to proyas to compromise his vision to create something virtually impossible to walk out of saying i dont get it <>
that kind of storytelling buys you long slow boat rides down a cinematic canal where explorations of a shattered human mindscape give way to the pointless tourguide ramblings of sir kiefer exposition <>

{0} i suspect that there was a great deal of good feeling on the set of twilight the kind that comes when people believe theyre about to make a point <>
after all this would be a film where the title could be interpreted two ways <>
on the one hand it would evoke the appropriately moody atmosphere required in a tale of hollywood murder blackmail and corruption this one centered on a retired private eye named harry ross paul newman and his complex friendship with two aging movie stars cancerstricken jack ames gene hackman and his wife catherine susan sarandon <>
on the other hand it would describe the cast of veteran actors and the charactes they play all trying to show they are just as vital in the present as they were in the past <>
it would be a sly subtle story brought to life by a group of sly subtle performers <>
{-2} perhaps too sly and subtle for its own good <>
as a narrative twilight offers virtually nothing you havent seen in a dozen other mysteries set among southern californias privileged set dirty cops friends who turn out to be enemies enemies who turn out to be friends wads of cash exchanging hands a little rough stuff a little gratuitous nudity <>
this one happens to focus on the yearold unsolved disappearance of catherines first husband though that focus is fuzzy at best <>
subplots and supporting characters materialize with alarming frequency far too many to be fleshed out adequately in the lean minutes provided by robert benton and richard russos script <>
twilight introduces enough ideas about decaying affluence and influence that it always seems to be moving forward <>
it just doesnt feel like its headed anywhere in particular <>
{1} the only reason twilight doesnt feel like a thoroughly generic timewaster and in fact offers a moderate level of satisfaction is the pleasure which comes from watching great actors share the screen <>
newman wears the layers of disappointment in harrys copturnedshamusturneddrunk life like an old sweater yet maintains a core of idealistic morality <>
his scenes with hackman stockard channing as an old flame and current police lieutenant and james garner as another excop gone private sector spill over with the easy chatter of old friends directed by benton kramer vs kramer nobodys fool in his typical restrained style <>
{-1} in fact the actors are so good that they might trick you into thinking youre watching wellrounded characters <>
its only when reese witherspoon liev schreiber and giancarlo esposito stumble over their underdeveloped parts that it becomes apparent how sketchy those characters truly are <>
twilight generally feels rushed together as an opportunity for all these actors to appear in a movie together for all the talking going on its tough to get a handle on who these people really are <>
theres a fair amount of sharp tart dialogue to go around <>
unfortunately not enough of it is used to bring the characters into focus <>
{1} the best clue as to what twilight is really all about comes from a minor subplot which finds several old friends of harrys mistakenly believing that a gunshot wound has left him ahem less a man <>
harry laughs richly at the rumor when he learns of it but the film may take the idea a bit more seriously <>
the principal male characters in twilight all seem to be worrying about the degeneration of their lives into physical ailments inertia and selfpity in a town where youth is worshipped they may be wondering whether or not they can still perform <>
its intriguing to watch both the actors and the characters trying to redefine themselves in the present and put their past behind them <>
and maybe thats even enough subtext to give twilight the edge it needs to make up for its lack of actual text <>
the story may be only halffinished but the stars sure arent <>

{-1} ive gotta admit i have a real hard time taking adam sandler seriously as a romantic leading man <>
and apparently im not alone in that respect sandler himself seems to be having a real hard time taking himself seriously as a romantic leading man throughout the wedding singer <>
sandler stars as robby hart a onetime aspiring rockandroller now making a meager living playing wedding receptions and bar mitzvahs circa <>
after being left at the altar by a fiancee angela featherstone who cant deal with his lowrent career robby begins losing the will to sing you spin me round like a record substituting love stinks <>
thats before he begins spending time with julia sullivan drew barrymore a sweet waitress engaged to a pastel shirtwearing vaguely unshaven don johnson wannabe named glenn matthew glave <>
{-1} its surprising and refreshing to watch a performer like sandler try to stretch himself after a string of roles which required him either to scream destroy things or scream while destroying things <>
its also a bit goofy <>
when sandlers bighaired fiancee explains why she doesnt love him any more the closeup of sandlers twitchy face suggests someone trying hard not to burst out laughing when he explains to julia how he dreams of being a songwriter his expression suggests someone trying hard not to burst out laughing <>
i was surprised not to find an outtake reel over the closing credits of the wedding singer since it looked like dozens of takes must have ended with sandler in the middle of a massive giggle fit <>
{2} its a good thing that the pleasant but improbable romance doesnt have to carry the wedding singer <>
the real star of the show is the mids milieu a soundtrack full of the eras onehit wonders pop tunes threadperfect costuming by mona may clueless knowing references to the eventual breakup of van halen and several famous couples <>
in fact the wedding singer is one of the more consistently chucklefilled comedies of the last several months <>
though never outandout hilarious or inspired tim herlihys script with uncredited assist from carrie fisher among others gets solid mileage out of its kitschy atmosphere lively cameos by steve buscemi jon lovitz and billy idol as himself and one priceless moment involving a string quartets solemn rendition of journeys dont stop believin <>
even drew barrymore acquits herself admirably in the uncommon role of the nice girl <>
{0} still theres something eversoslightly askew about adam sandler trying to get away with the hushed tones and puppydog eyes of a sensitive relationship kinda guy <>
he may be an actor some day but hes not there yet hes still primarily a happygolucky anarchist with a talent for silly voices and even sillier songs <>
robbys performance scenes are certainly where sandler seems most comfortable particularly as he tears into a diatribe against his ex or a lyrically amusing ode to growing old with julia <>
when he steps off the stage and into his best faux john cusack it just looks like its all he can do to keep a straight face <>
the wedding singer turns out to be an entertaining way to spend minutes laughing at the past <>
in a different way it may be just as funny watching sandler spend minutes laughing at an alternative future <>

{0} a moment of mild understatement people of christian faith havent fared well in film <>
when hollywood was still afraid to offend christian characters were flawless saltoftheearth folks later as cinematic taboos vanished through the s and s religion became a sure sign of either mental illness or hypocrisy <>
improbably extremes ruled with few filmmakers bothering to delve into the complex middle ground occupied by millions of americans flawed human beings who are nevertheless completely sincere and devoted to their faith <>
{2} pentecostal minister euliss f sonny dewey the title character in the apostle may be the most wonderfully complex christian character ever depicted on film and every ounce of credit for that creation goes to robert duvall <>
duvall wrote directed and stars as sonny a man with an unfailing passion for his calling as a preacher <>
unfortunately he also has an unfailing passion for women leading his wife jessie farrah fawcett to throw him out of the house and engineer his ouster from his church <>
the shorttempered sonny responds by taking a baseball bat to the head of jessies new lover then quickly taking it on the lam from his home in texas to bayou boutte louisiana <>
there he rechristens himself the apostle e f dedicating himself to beginning a new ministry in his new home <>
{2} duvall works wonders with sonny depicting every possible facet of this complicated mans personality <>
an early scene in which sonny stops at the scene of an automobile accident to guide a critically injured young man to salvation depicts the singleminded necessarily arrogant conviction of the evangelist that everyone needs saving as well as the accompanying prideful glee when he succeeds <>
sonnys belief that his work as a preacher supercedes all other obligations unifies every action from his rationalization of his infidelities to his decision to run from the law <>
duvall even touches humorously on the reaction of others to sonnys fervor one man who offers sonny hospitality also sleeps warily with a shotgun by his side <>
{-1} if theres one major stumbling block in the apostle it is that the other characters in the film exist entirely to react to sonny <>
while the performances are uniformly strong and naturalistic the supporting players rarely seem to have lives of their own <>
from jessie to the young mechanic walter goggins who becomes sonnys close friend to a racist troublemaker billy bob thornton all serve as spectators or functional props in the story of sonnys redemption <>
duvall commits so much energy to making this one character completely real that he has little left to spend on anyone else <>
{1} you may not end up minding all that much since that one character becomes so fascinating <>
duvall has long been one of americas finest actors but this is the kind of role into which he disappears most completely slightly roguish but unmistakably human souls like his roles in tender mercies and lonesome dove <>
when sonny gives his final sermon in the apostle in a sequence which lingers and builds in intensity you realize exactly what duvall is aiming at <>
it is possible for a man who is quicktempered stubborn and unfaithful to his wife to change lives for the better it doesnt take a saint to be a good christian <>
ultimately the apostle is a strange sort of character study because sonny doesnt really change all that much <>
like most wellintentioned by imperfect people he just keeps trying to be better <>

{0} ive always wanted to be in films says dancerchoreographer pablo veron at one point in the tango lesson to which writerdirector sally potter replies ive always wanted to be a dancer <>
well both get their chance in a grating featurelength selfindulgence disguised as a fanciful romance <>
potter plays a filmmaker named sally visiting paris after difficulties getting financing for her latest project which is thoroughly unbelievable since the project in question involves the pure box office gold of models dressed in primary colors pursued by a legless fashion designer <>
there she meets veron and convinces the dancer to teach her the tango <>
along the way they sort of fall in love dance sort of break up dance some more sort of get back together again and dance a whole lot more <>
{-2} somewhere buried in this collection of dance sequences are a few meditations on ones calling in life the need to surrender control and the connections between various art forms <>
more power to you if you manage to exhume them <>
the tango lesson carries no emotional pull since both lead performers have the seasoned acting chops ofwell a director and a dancer <>
some of the dance sequences are impressive particularly verons solo tap number in a kitchen but the portentous and pretentious flow of the narrative robs them of all joy imagine gene kelly directed by fellini and youll understand why the tango lesson is such a bizarre experience <>
robby mullers typically impressive blackandwhite cinematography only emphasizes that the film is an empty visual exercise a project so personal it can only leave the audience wondering why in the world it should care <>
potters spin on fellinis is merely a moderately depressing record of the filmmakers midlife crisis in which she attempts to assure the world that she could too be a ballerina if she really wanted to <>

i dont ask much of my monster movies but i do ask that they act like monster movies <>
you dont have to show me a fantastically impressive massive beast with tentacles aflailing <>
just show me the massive beast burping and ill figure you get the point <>

{0} woody allen spends minutes blurring the lines between life and art in deconstructing harry <>
allen plays harry block a loathsome little worm of a successful writer who turns his misery and philandering into the subjects for his stories <>
understandably this becomes a sore point for the exwives and exlovers who populate his work as thinlydisguised analogs its bad enough dealing with harry in real life without being subjected to further indignities in fictional form <>
throughout the film we get a chance to see harrys autobiographical tales brought to life with different actors playing the roles of various individuals in his life julia louisdreyfuss as onetime lover judy davis demi moore as second wife kirstie alley and so on <>
{-1} its a fairly successful conceit one which allows allen to take off on some extremely funny flights of fancy <>
robin williams has a neat cameo as an actor having trouble getting focused literally while an elevator trip to hell becomes an opportunity to tear into occupations worthy of a special place among the damned the media lawyers who appear on television <>
allen has plenty of fun with the narrative device but that same device also points out one major casting problem in deconstructing harry with all the surrogate roleplaying going on allen should have found someone else to play harry block <>
{-2} in part its because the levels of selfreferentiality become wearying <>
allen is playing himself in a semiautobiographical story about a writer who writes semiautobiographical stories in which he sometimes plays himself and so on to infinity like some doublemirror effect <>
more to the point allen isnt deft enough as an actor or egoless enough as a director to make harry truly repugnant <>
in order for us to take deconstructing harry seriously as allens acknowledgement that art does not forgive all harry needs to be more than a pathetic little nebbish <>
another actor might have given harrys misogynistic rantings and rationalizations genuine bite allens desperate need to be accepted and understood bathes his every moment on screen in apologetic blandness <>
{-1} of course its just as easy to read deconstructing harry as allens argument that art does forgive all <>
and in some ways the film is its own best argument teasing the audience with goofy entertainment whenever its not making halfhearted attempts to dig into harrys psyche <>
perhaps it does matter to some viewers whether or not allen is a horrible human being with a morally reprehensible personal life <>
me ill settle for being treated to a bunch of laughs once a year <>
unfortunately allen has been spending most of the last several years using his films as feature length pr announcements for himself <>
deconstructing harry is as effective in its comedy as it is distracting in its selfabsorption blurring the line between life and art just enough to make you wish allen could blur it a bit more <>

{0} james l brooks has a rare gift as a filmmaker the ability to give the people what they want while also giving them what he wants <>
terms of endearment was a crowdpleasing tearjerker buoyed by smart comedy and rich characterizations broadcast news brought a throwback romantic comedy sensibility to an upscale study of journalistic ethics with an unexpectedly downbeat conclusion <>
even the notorious little musical that wasnt ill do anything demonstrated brooks willingness to cut bait when he knew the audience had no interest in what he was offering <>
his instincts have proven as irreproachable as they are unconventional <>
{-1} as good as it gets had the potential for a classic written all over it <>
for once however brooks doesnt have a grip on how best to handle his material <>
he casts jack nicholson as a bilespewing satyr then turns him into a repentant bilespewing satyr <>
he crafts an appealing relationship between two troubled and mismatched characters then muddles the mix by throwing in a third troubled character <>
he takes minutes of great material and drags it out over nearly two and a half hours <>
{1} it didnt have to be like that <>
as good as it gets has a wonderful character at its center a truly horrible human being named melvin udall nicholson <>
a reclusive writer diagnosed with obsessivecompulsive disorder melvin has turned his condition into carte blanche to insult and berate everyone with whom he comes in contact <>
that includes carol connelly helen hunt the waitress who serves him breakfast every morning and goes double for his neighbor gay artist simon bishop greg kinnear <>
then unexpectedly melvin finds himself forced to do something for someone else caring for simons dog verdell after simon is beaten in a robbery attempt <>
that one act seems to launch melvin on a spate of selflessness including helping carol with her sickly son and driving simon to meet with his estranged parents <>
{-1} its an admirable theme for a film this notion of a man deciding to change himself when he realizes the effect those changes have on other people <>
but why of all people jack nicholson <>
the preconversion melvin is an outrageous delight getting away with hateful rantings few other characters could without inspiring protests <>
his growth as a character saps him of all his badboy energy leaving in its place a tricky romance with hunt which somehow works even with nicholson perpetually looking like hes straining at the end of a leash <>
{0} that romance might have been even more effective if brooks had kept his attention fixed on how melvin and carol are so good and so bad for each other <>
hunt is superb and heartbreaking as the single mother struggling to discover how to live her own life again matching nicholson for dontmesswithme vigor <>
yet theres always simon there in the background a distracting tangent the lightweight kinnear cant invest with sufficient gravity <>
his story adds little but the adorably grungy verdell a couple of showboating scenes for cuba gooding jr as a fuming art dealer and a lot of padding to an already overlong film <>
{-1} brooks is too adept with a witty line to turn out a tedious film and nicholson and hunt too capable to fumble the wellrounded characterizations <>
as good as it gets simply turns out to be a rare case of brooks failing to ride what works for all its worth <>
its funny but fitful because we know this isnt as good as a james l brooks film gets <>

[10264/1]
{-2} its a truly surreal experience sitting through a film like an american werewolf in paris with your mind overwhelmed by a piercing cry of what were they thinking <>
john landis an american werewolf in london was hardly an inviolable classic but it was crafty and creative a comic horror film which was both genuinely scary and genuinely funny <>
an american werewolf in paris on the other hand is genuinely unwatchable a collection of bad ideas thrown onto the screen without any apparent consideration to little details like coherence or appeal to an audience <>
{-1} the tragedy is that director anthony waller proved he could mix tension and comic relief quite effectively in his debut feature mute witness <>
in paris he merely regurgitates londons premise of americans abroad with protagonist andy mcdermott tom everett scott and his buddies brad vince vieluf and chris phil buckman replacing backpackers david naughton and griffin dunne <>
the trio is on a daredevil tour of europe tallying up their respective testosterone points for endangering their lives or seducing women as college chums are wont to do <>
its not part of the plan to get tangled up with a den of werewolves but thats exactly what happens when andy saves the life of the suicidal serafine julie delpy <>
soon andy joins the ranks of the wolfen and must try to kill the wolf who bit him while also finding a cure for serafine <>
{-2} what follows is so misguided on so many levels that it becomes horrifying for all the wrong reasons <>
the male leads fumble with inane dialogue including such gen xauthentic ripostes as this is madness julie delpy meanwhile is obliged to humiliate herself with one of the lamest and most unnecessary nude scenes ever filmed <>
the attempts at humor range from turning a pair of undead characters into fourthrate rejects from the frighteners to the wildly hilarious conceit that andy get this keeps bumping his head on everything in sight <>
waller directs it all as though guided by the humanitarian desire just to get it over with with baffling unexplained resolutions leading to a cringeinducing happy ending which looks like it was stolen from some mids shlock comedy starring andrew mccarthy <>
{-2} its all the more aggravating when a film this sloppy pretends to be interested in making some sort of social statement <>
the primary villains in paris are a group of pseudoskinheads who have intentionally infected themselves with wereblood so that they might more efficiently rid french society of its contaminating elements vagrants junkies american tourists <>
if the point was to make americans feel better about encountering mere attitude in paris rather than fleshrending canine teeth mission accomplished <>
if wallers intent was to offer some metaphorical indictment of whoknowswhat its lost in his frantic storytelling long before we can nod in sociallyconscious superiority <>
{-2} some viewers will undoubtedly trek to paris simply to see a genre film but even they are likely to be disappointed <>
the computergenerated werewolves are thoroughly unimpressive and the transformation scene tossed off so quickly youll be instantly nostalgic for rick bakers incredible makeup effects from london <>
the script makes its token attempts to spice up the werewolf legend with a few new details and some pseudoscience but none of it generates thrills or scares just a couple of moderately effective grossouts <>
if they want to add a new twist to lycanthropic mythology heres a suggestion anyone who makes a werewolf movie this bad becomes one of them <>
the line to fire the silver bullets forms behind me <>

[10225/4]
{-1} michelle yeoh is ultimately the best thing about tomorrow never dies the th installment in the phenomenally popular series based on ian flemings james bond pierce brosnan <>
and in a strange way she also points out its most glaring weaknesses <>
you see bond may be a brand name but as i noted in my review of goldeneye the franchise no longer has the market cornered on highflying globehopping action <>
when the alternatives to the latest bond adventure include watching the dazzling jackie chan battle international espionage with considerably more imagination tomorrow never dies starts to look rather bland and uninspired <>
the presence of yeoh chans capable sidekick in supercop only serves as a reminder that there are new kids on the block <>
brosnan may look appropriately dapper but the series just looks old cruising on its place in cinematic history <>
{-1} the premise has a kind of perfunctory bondian grandiosity about it despite an extremely lackluster villain <>
jonathan pryce plays elliot carver an international media mogul just about to launch a new satellite news network <>
operating on the principle that its easier to create news than to hunt it down carver and his operatives begin making their own headlines by instigating a conflict between the british navy and china one which results in a downed british battleship and talk of war <>
enter bond assigned to determine the dirty details of carvers operation <>
ably assisted by chinese government agent wai lin yeoh bond must stop the presses before carvers meddling results in allout war between england and china <>
{-2} the hohum megalomania of pryce and his obligatory inhumanly resilient henchman gotz otto are only part of an extremely familiar package which prevents tomorrow never dies from ever getting off the ground <>
token attempts at adding depth to bonds romantic conquests he really cares about old flame teri hatcherno really he does fall flat but thats no great surprise <>
the real disappointment is the quality of the action set pieces a few flashes of creativity chaotically directed by roger spottiswoode air america turner and hooch to lend the illusion of real energy <>
the gunplay is routine the chases are routine even qs gadgets are routine a car that drops little spikey things to flatten the tires of the car behind youwhat will he think of next <>
even peppering the action with traditional bond quips doesnt help especially when most of the audience is baffled into silence by a reference to carvers edifice complex <>
{1} the only real change of pace is yeoh who provides the bond series with its best most exciting leading lady in years with all due respect to maud adams and grace jones <>
shes such a match for bond just as resourceful and even more physically capable that its a shame to see her reduced to damselindistress status <>
watching yeoh fly through an acrobatic martial arts fight sequence conjures images of the more inventive stunt wizardry of jackie chans films <>
chan has been outbonding bond for years now a detail its hard to overlook while tomorrow never dies is punching and exploding its way through two hours on automatic pilot <>
{-1} pierce brosnan once again provides bond with an appropriate ruthlessness but hes also burdened with the anachronistic heman antics <>
much of the continued appeal of the series can be attributed to the fact that the more things change the more james bond remains the same in the liberated safesex designated driver s hes still an unabashed chauvinist who sleeps around drinks his vodka martinis and kicks ass for queen and country <>
that sense of familiarity may be the series greatest financial strength but its also its greatest impediment to quality <>
once upon a time the james bond series was a biannual festival of can you top this <>
the goal is simpler now the producers arent even trying to compete with the bigbudget big boys <>
they rely on one secret weapon not provided by q nostalgia <>
tomorrow never dies never once tries to play can you top this <>
its a film content to offer do you remember this <>

{0} in the three years since pulp fiction dazzled critics raked in million at the box office and polarized academy voters it has become fashionable to brand quentin tarantino with that favored label of contrarian pundits everywhere overrated <>
many film buffs dismissed him as a cinematic plagiarist or a profane wordsmith drunk on his own familiarity with pop culture his attempts at acting destiny turns on the radio from dusk till dawn were viewed as ego run amok <>
with a three year output behind the camera consisting of one er episode and a lackluster segment of the illadvised four rooms it was easy to start asking questions <>
had the flavor of the month lost his flavor on the bedpost overnight <>
{1} a lot of those same folks are going to see jackie brown as a validation of their suspicions <>
after all its not the kind of dizzying heartstopping moralityplaydisguisedasnihilism pulp fiction was <>
its simply a wellcrafted elmore leonard caper based on his novel rum punch about a middleaged flight attendant named jackie brown pam grier caught in a tight spot <>
nailed by atf agent ray nicolet michael keaton for transporting cash and cocaine into the country from mexico jackie faces jail time unless shes willing to give up the man shes acting as courier for <>
that man is ordell robbie samuel l jackson a gunrunner who has already shown a reluctance to let potential snitches remain among the living <>
faced with a nowin situation jackie decides she wants to win anyway elisting the aid of bail bondsman max cherry robert forster in a sting where she hopes everyone but her will get stung <>
{1} both fans and foes of tarantino tend to fixate on his writing but jackie brown may prove once and for all that the man is a remarkably talented film director <>
he does things with his camera that keep viewers offbalance while avoiding the swooping ostentation of many young filmmakers <>
at times he will linger on a shot just after a character has moved out of frame at other times he may shoot a conversation from behind the characters backs <>
in one hilariously perfect scene he uses complete darkness to build tension complemented by an expertly handled splitscreen to deliver the punch line <>
he directs a scene with such confidence that he can convince a viewer to follow wherever hes leading because it always seems to be somewhere slightly unexpected <>
{1} hes also got a gift for directing actors most directors will never have <>
john travolta samuel l jackson and bruce willis gave the performances of their careers in pulp fiction even uma thurman had an uncommon intensity <>
in jackie brown tarantino resurrects the careers of not one but two forgotten actors of the s <>
most of the press has gone to pam grier still looking as foxy as she did in the s as she plays nobodysvictim jackie <>
grier does fine work but its robert forster who breaks out of jackie brown with a superb performance <>
a veteran of bgrade cop shows like nakia and banyon forster plays the worldweary cherry with natural charisma and a touching affection for jackie <>
in a cast full of heavy hitters like samuel l jackson and robert deniro both of whom are also topnotch grier and forster make an unexpected romance between two people past their hollywoodpretty prime funny sexy and convincing <>
{1} its true that jackie brown includes plenty of familiar elements from previous tarantino efforts bursts of unpredictable violence twelveletter profanities by the truckload nonlinear narrative creative use of old songs doing for strawberry letter what reservoir dogs did for stuck in the middle with you <>
its also true that jackie brown moves at the kind of measured pace which could have some tarantino fans tapping their toes with impatience <>
its not an instant classic just a sharp piece of entertainment with the kind of tightlystructured script you wish tarantino could teach to other writers <>
i found it hard not to smile virtually from start to finish in jackie brown not because its constantly amusing but because its such a pleasure to be in the hands of someone who knows how to use the medium <>
even if its an overrated plagiarizing flavor of the month like quentin tarantino <>

{2} the best documentaries manage to uncover truths deeper than their most obvious subjects the best documentarians recognize that they can use the film medium to tell stories as compelling as anything fictional <>
little girls a powerful tale of tragic loss turned into positive action is more than the sort of talking head video textbook most people envision when they think of conventional documentaries <>
it is the work of a filmmaker who knows how to provoke viewers while he educates them who has experience examining the challenging subject of race in america <>
that gentlemans name is spike lee <>
{0} lee begins at the ending in little girls opening with an elegiac remembrance of four victims of a racially motivated church bombing in birmingham alabama in yearold denise mcnair yearold carole robertson yearold cynthia wesley and yearold addie mae collins <>
through photographs and interviews with family and friends we come to know the four girls not merely as symbols but as individuals remembered fondly as vibrant lives cut short <>
the prologue accompanied by the mournful joan baez ballad birmingham sunday concludes with potent images the smiling young faces of the four girls superimposed over their gravestones <>
{1} from there lee launches into a history in brief of the civil rights movement in birmingham one which never feels like a typical documentary <>
the knowledge of the tragedy to come lends context and consequenct to the battles of the civil rights activists it is a battle which we know will have its casualties <>
and the knowledge of those casualties adds even more resonance to an unforgettable moment in which former alabama governor george wallace reduced by strokes to an incomprehensibility requiring subtitles desperately attempts to convince lee that he is a changed man by showing off his black best friend <>
little girls creates a vivid portrait of alabama in the s rich with detailed characterizations which make it feel like lee always has his eye towards creating a narrative <>
{2} for all the historical detail lee never loses sight of the centerpiece of the film <>
the recollections of the bombing itself are shattering none more so than denise mcnairs mother recounting the subtle condescension she faces when she attempts to see her daughters body <>
its unfortunate that lee follows those scenes with the indictment and trial of dynamite bob chambliss for the killings by far the weakest sequence in the film <>
it may have provided a necessary closure to show the criminal eventually brought to justice but little girls is much more powerful detailing how this tragedy became a catalyst for change in the public perception of southern racism was affected around the world <>
lee also offers frightening comparisons to the recent spate of black church burnings in the south highlighting his ability to make the film many things at once a memorial a history lesson an opportunity for healing a warning to stay vigilant <>
little girls is a gripping experience an epic testament to triumph over hatred which never forgets the very personal loss of four families who still miss their four little girls <>

{-1} the obvious question associated with the creation of home alone is why though not for the obvious reasons <>
youd certainly expect a third installment from a series where the first two racked up a collective million even if the star of those two films has been spending more time lately in court than on screen <>
its just that home alone guru john hughes has been doing a perfectly serviceable job of recycling that successful formula without using the home alone name <>
babys day out dalmatians and flubber have managed to turn pratfalls scatology and groin injuries into cash without conjuring up the yelping visage of macaulay culkin <>
why start now <>
{-2} why indeed especially if youre going to fumble the formula the way home alone does <>
the required elements appear to be in place a youngster alex d linz as alex pruitt absentee parents a snowcovered midwestern suburb nefarious intruders several severe bodily injuries and property damage in the sixfigure range but everything feels just slightly askew <>
the little boy rather than being a mischievous imp is a minor scientific genius and allaround upstanding citizen <>
goofy antagonists joe pesci and daniel stern have been replaced by olek krupa rya kihlstedt lenny von dohlen and david thornton as international criminals looking for a stolen missile guidance chip in alexs possession characters a bit too chilly and sinister to be fun <>
and the direction by raja gosnell taking over for chris columbus drags the pace so badly during the first hour that kids may be snoring long before they chuckle for the first time <>
{-2} now no one has ever accused me of championing john hughes modus operandi in the s when he lost all interest in films for viewers over the age of <>
in fact im pretty sure its one of the biblical signs of the endtimes <>
but lets face it the formula works <>
hughes has made the liveaction warner bros cartoon his personal dominion home alone is basically a road runnercoyote adventure where the road runner has finally gotten his hands on the acme catalog <>
home alone includes all of hughes most annoying habits cloying sentimentality utter disdain for adults crotchlevel comedy with little of the mitigating frivolousness <>
the road runner turns into a rhodes scholar wile e coyote into a james bond villain and the triphammer pacing something more suited to merchant ivory than chuck jones <>
{-2} of course i cant recall a merchant ivory film which included so many different things dropped on peoples heads <>
the villains in home alone are brained from above with books barbells decorative flower pots a lawn mower lumber and human excrement among other things which nick glenniesmiths relentlessly whimsical score reminds us is jolly good fun <>
certainly all the mayhem will keep the kids giggling assuming you rouse them from their naps but there are so many different ways to see exactly the same material with more energy and at significantly less cost <>
john hughes has done himself in by turning out a home alone which cant keep up with home alone home alone or the dozen other de facto sequels which didnt happen to bear the home alone name <>

{0} i think it happened around with the release of the exorcist though some might go back to night of the living dead in <>
prior to that point cinematic horror was generally restricted to innocuous creature features and the occasional genuine thriller psycho the haunting which was more in your head than in your face <>
the phenomenal success of the exorcist changed all that giving rise to the notion that the way to shake up an audience was from the stomach out <>
and so there came texas chainsaw massacre and brian depalmas carrie and john carpenters halloween and a decade of slasher film wannabes too numerous to count <>
special makeup effects became hollywoods growth field of the s turning experts like dick smith rick baker rob bottin and tom savini into talent as hot as any star <>
there was even one teen scream film happy birthday to me which trumpeted in its ad campaign that it contained some of the most bizarre murders you will ever see <>
the cult of the grossout had been born dedicated to the principle that if you came up with new and innovative ways to hack the human body to ribbons they would come <>
{1} wishmaster a limp and generally tedious horror film about an ancient djinn andrew divoff accidentally released into modernday america by a jewelry appraiser tammy lauren would have no reason to exist if not to show off a gaggle of grotesqueries skin flayed from flesh a skeleton tearing loose from its body eviscerations by the cartload cancerous pustules erupting on a pharmacists skin all manner of creepycrawlies emerging from the orifices of human hosts a face indented by an iron mace like something out of a warner bros cartoon and a few gardenvariety shootings for street cred <>
director robert kurtzman a former specialeffects man handed a basic premise for a story an ancient djinn loose in modernday america a budget and an r rating occasionally stumbles across an innovative visual idea which doesnt involve exposing anatomical features generally hidden from view <>
more often when in doubt he lets loose with the red karo syrup <>
{-1} wishmaster also wouldnt exist without a few noteworthy antecedents like the man in the bottle episode of the original twilight zone and the monkeys paw <>
screenwriter peter atkins seems convinced that his notion of a malevolent genie is wildly original and that the idea of that genie providing literalist renderings of vague wishes is positively ingenious <>
in fact the results of the wishes range from fairly uninspired to purely plagiaristic stop me if youve heard the one about the guy who wishes for a million dollars then has a family member with an insurance policy die <>
an original idea isnt necessary when you can take an old one and spice it up with stateoftheart visceraspilling <>
{-2} like far too many supernatural horror films about half of wishmasters exposition seems devoted to explaining the detailed rules for how the monster wreaks his havoc how he can be destroyed etc <>
the good news is that that exposition provides a few memorable moments for jenny ohara sharp and sassy as the occult expert every monster movie needs <>
the bad news is that the whole business is pointless a foolish stab at internal logic in a genre where internal logic matters far less than what kind of mayhem a djinn can inflict when someone wishes for a wild party <>
horror films can work when the people who make them display a sense for the giddy catharsis of a good scare but theres nothing scary about wishmaster unless you count the halfdozen or so times the music cranks up to a decibel level just this side of the concorde <>
its just a humorless display of specialeffects prowess the latest installment in the ongoing game of can you top this which all began when zombies noshed on human femurs or when linda blair first returned a can of pea soup whence it came <>

{-1} in an uncertain world theres something strangely reassuring about the films of steven seagal <>
the economy may rise and fall but seagal will always dispatch all adversaries with the same vaguely bored smirk and without a hair in his ponytail drifting out of place <>
you cant depend on political institutions but you can depend on the fact that seagal will put together a wardrobe where nary a pastel nor a tshirt will be found <>
all else changes but seagal stays the same the same facial expression the same tone of voice for every emotion the same humorless selfimportance <>
he is stasis personified <>
{-1} theres not much new to say about fire down below because theres not much new to see <>
seagal plays a tough guy who dresses in black for what its worth his name is jack taggart <>
his cause is righteous a nasty industrialist is dumping toxic waste in a rural kentucky coal mine and seagal is the epas resident aikido master <>
bad guys get in the way almost invariably four or five at a time <>
bones end up broken almost invariably four or five at a time <>
{-2} and none of those bones ever belong to seagals character <>
a seagal fight sequence is uniquely monotonous not just because the hero always wins action heroes usually win but because no one ever lays a finger on him <>
i doubt seagal will ever make a truly thrilling action thriller and yes that includes under siege because his ego could never permit any doubt as to the outcome his action scenes are like harlem globetrotters games without the showmanship <>
when he appears in one scene in fire down below with a wee cut over his left eyebrow after outracing a homicidal trucker you wonder how much convincing it took before seagal allowed himself to bleed <>
{-2} its that ego of his which makes so many seagal films so wonderfully terribly predictable <>
when he stops fire down below dead in its tracks to give a miniversion of his on deadly ground speech on environmental responsibility you know its because he genuinely believes someone cares what he thinks on the subject <>
when he stops it yet again to show off his downhome guitar stylings you know its because he just cant help himself <>
when he works with directors like bruce malmuth geoff murphy john gray and now felix enriquez alcala a virtual whos who of whos he you know its because hes not about to take orders <>
and when he tries to work up some sensitive romantic chemistry with marg helgenberger you want to laugh out loud at the idea that he could love anyone as much as he loves himself <>
{-2} sure you can always count on a few token surprises most of them completely ridiculous <>
theres a needless and unpleasant subplot about incestuous siblings nothing like dismantling appalachian stereotypes and a few colorful bursts of conveniently fluorescent toxic goop <>
theres even kris kristofferson as the slimy head heavy sharing a couple of scenes and a squinting contest for the ages with our leading man <>
mostly however theres more of the same fightchaseexplosion narrative structure and automoton emoting which makes the latest steven seagal film a natural sequel to the last steven seagal film <>
theres nothing remotely entertaining about fire down below but theres something steadying about seagals artistic intransigence <>
he wont go deserting us to do hamlet on broadway or take a pay cut to work on an independent film <>
in turbulent times you can almost take comfort in the knowledge that one mans name is as good as a plot description <>

{-1} a plot synopsis for a smile like yours reads like the most generic of bittersweet romantic comedies <>
danny greg kinnear and jennifer robertson lauren holly are a happily married young san francisco couple with a bright future until jennifer decides that its time for baby to make three <>
attempts at conception put a damper on their oncevibrant sex life little white lies develop into larger deceptions <>
danny begins to suspect jennifer of cheating with a cosmetics executive christopher mcdonald while jennifer similarly suspects danny of cheating with a gorgeous architect jill hennessy <>
eventually tensions cause a genuine rift between the two <>
sounds quite a bit like shes having a baby doesnt it <>
{-2} only its more like shes not having a baby because a smile like yours is a bittersweet romantic comedy about infertility <>
thats right all the wacky hijinks of masturbating into a cup <>
all the sidesplitting humor of spending an hour in stirrups <>
all the unbridled hilarity of smalltalk with another pair of clinic patients who reveal their history with gonorrhea and pelvic inflammatory disease <>
{-2} i can understand the temptation to search for humor in a subject as frustrating embarrassing and occasionally guiltinducing as fertility problems <>
perhaps either writerdirector keith samples or his cowriter kevin meyer had some personal experience in this area and felt the need to share their quest for a smile amidst the tears <>
and it might have worked if they had bothered to include a single honest moment in a smile like yours <>
there is no attempt to understand how danny and jennifer really feel about their dilemma no sense of any genuine pain <>
samples and meyer have merely grafted a few scenes at a fertility clinic onto a fluffy and absurdly predictable relationship comedy forcing you to wonder why it couldnt just as easily have been about a couple struggling with financial problems or an irritating relative or the heartbreak of psoriasis <>
{-2} its actually fairly impressive how generic and predictable a smile like yours turns out to be <>
the casting certainly doesnt help matters offering the mundanely attractive kinnear and holly as our protagonists without once stepping inside their heads we never learn why jennifer is so underhanded about trying to get pregnant considering danny seems perfectly comfortable with the idea <>
even the supporting cast jay thomas as the acerbic guy pal joan cusack as the daffy gal pal appears to have been generated by a computer program <>
the film is so ennervated for so long that a late cameo by shirley maclaine provides virtually the entire energy quotient in three minutes of screen time <>
for an hour and a half a smile like yours trudges in the most obvious directions reaching a grating climax in a scene where several agonizing seconds pass between the moment we know jennifer is going to call dannys hotel room and find another woman there and the moment the phone actually rings <>
{-2} infertility may be a delicate issue but its hardly sacrosanct <>
a competent filmmaking team might have made either an exaggerated black comedy or a more sensitive comedydrama about the issue <>
it deserves much better than to become an afterthought in a story which has nothing creative or insightful to offer on any subject <>
you know youre in trouble when the biggest laugh in a film comes during a scene when a character is watching a rerun of i love lucyand the laugh is actually at the rerun of i love lucy <>
lucy is still funnier and more inventive after years than a smile like yours is after minutes <>

{-2} as a public service im going to provide a simple conversion formula to help potential viewers decide whether or not they should see money talks begin with a base of zero on a scale if you found chris tucker a riotous comedic presence in films like friday and the fifth element add points if tuckers every moment on screen during the fifth element made you want to tear out your own central nervous system with a shrimp fork subtract points <>
{-2} those individuals blissfully unfamiliar with the chris tucker oeuvre may be confused at this point <>
i envy such sweet naivete <>
tucker may be the most actively annoying screen presence sincewell ever comes to mind <>
blessed with a shudderinducing nasal whine of a voice tucker dares the audience to tolerate him by playing characters who simply refuse to shut up <>
in money talks he plays a motormouthed ticket scalper named franklin hatchett who gets busted after investigative reporter james russell charlie sheen does an expose <>
franklin then ends up in a prison transport with a french smuggler gerard ismael whose operatives kill both cops and cons in the course of rescuing him <>
naturally franklin is suspected of being part of the escape plan <>
naturally he seeks out james though there is no good reason for him to do so when his friends include a major arms dealer <>
naturally james is about to marry into a wealthy family giving franklin plenty of opportunities to shake up the upper crust <>
{-2} and naturally almost everyone franklin deals with is a complete idiot <>
franklin spends most of money talks taking shots at all the corrupt vennal brutal andor criminally stupid white people he encounters <>
that includes and goes double for charlie sheen whose sole purpose in the film is to stay near tucker so there is always someone close at hand for him to insult <>
considering the number of times franklin comments on james posterior its narrowness its whiteness or its need to be kicked youd think he might have a little crush on the fellow <>
of course just to make sure we know thats not the case there is a scene in which franklin rebuffs an aggressively affectionate gay man with whom he shares a jail cell <>
in an urban comedy youd better make sure the audience knows you find queers even more obnoxious than white people <>
{-2} the amazing thing about money talks is that tucker still manages to play the stupidest and most obnoxious character in the film <>
there is nothing remotely sympathetic or likeable about franklin unless it is that he actually seems to care about his pregnant girlfriend whom he sweettalks with a goodnatured threat to kick her ass <>
apparently tuckers fans find his routine hysterical the crowd roared its appreciation at every profanitypacked sentence tucker uses over choice epithets during the minutes of money talks <>
they also seemed thrilled every time something blew up or every time someone got shot <>
perhaps that is why watching money talks was such a doubly depressing experience <>
not only did i have to stomach tuckers grating presence in the kind of wretched buddy comedy which makes other wretched buddy comedies look inspired but i shared it with an audience which found high entertainment in the equivalent of rambo starring jerry lewis with tourettes syndrome <>
{-2} make that triply depressing if money talks is a success i could be sitting through another chris tucker project real soon <>

{-1} i have a theory that in an earlier stage of development the premise for a simple wish went something like this murray martin short who aspires to being the first male fairy godmother turns out to be completely inept at the job but an affirmative action mandate forces the godmothers to admit him <>
this would be before the realworld affirmative action debate heated up forcing controversyshy universal executives to drop that angle entirely <>
{-1} the theory ill admit is based on no evidence in the version of a simple wish which actually made it to the screen <>
the alternative unfortunately is that the story never made a shred of sense at any point in its development <>
its the kind of exasperating kiddie fantasy where stuff just happens without any character story or internal logic to guide it <>
{1} of course the stuff which does happen may be plenty to satisfy young viewers <>
in the course of his repeatedly bungled attempts to help young anabel greening mara wilson turn her father robert pastorelli into a broadway star murray gets caught in an iron gate causes a wind storm to sweep a teacher down a school hallway turns a redneck into a foot tall rabbi turns a horse into a mouse and has the fathers chief rival begin vomiting up frogs at an inopportune moment during his audition <>
meanwhile evil excommunicated godmother claudia kathleen turner who has an axe to grind and magic wands to steal has fun with computer graphics rendering folks either twodimensional or extremely pliable depending on the whim which seizes her <>
{-1} the special effects are admittedly temporarily distracting <>
when they stop however a simple wish borders on the unbearable <>
martin short who should be taken only in small doses even on his best days turns murray into a flinching snorting and generally annoying creation without a glimmer of charm <>
mara wilson who was so appealing in last years delightful matilda barely registers here at all while francis capra registers far too often as wilsons big brother <>
there is not a single likeable character in the film turning every scene into a long wait for some kind of goofy visual effect to snap you out of your stupor <>
{-1} all of these problems make the gaping hole at the center of the film all the more evident <>
a simple wish is based around a highconcept premise a male fairy godmother and an incompetent one at that yet not once is there any attempt to explain why he wanted to be a fairy godmother how he managed to become one or why no one is keeping an eye on him <>
in fact a simple wish is comprised of nothing but missed opportunities and halfdeveloped ideas <>
what goes on at the fairy godmothers convention which takes place during the film <>
does it matter that murray is using a broken wand for much of the film <>
why not make more use of the complicated rules of fairy godmotherhood which apparently are so abstruse that murray has to carry around a cheat sheet <>
and why does claudias assistant boots amanda plummer who is supposed to be a dog turned into a human look instead like a refugee from cats <>
{-1} time and again a simple wish wanders from scene to scene as though blissfully unconcerned about arriving at anything resembling a point <>
then again maybe someone got cold feet and stripped it of its point <>
its more charitable i think to imagine the darkly satirical film a simple wish might have been than to dwell on the muddled mess it turned out to be <>

{0} i was sitting next to a laugher as i watched gone fishin <>
when i say laugher i dont just mean someone who laughs loudly or someone who laughs frequently <>
i mean someone who laughs loudly and frequently <>
the most innocuous line of dialogue was greeted with a hearty chuckle while a fullfledged sight gag inspired the kind of explosive bellow which i was certain would cause a loss of bladder control <>
if disney had testscreened gone fishin for an audience comprised entirely of clones of this fellow the champagne corks would have been popping like bubble wrap in the hands of a yearold <>
{-2} under most circumstances the laugher would have annoyed me to distraction <>
in the case of gone fishin the distraction was welcome <>
the films breathtaking awfulness forced my mind to wander in sheer selfdefense leading me to spend a lot of time thinking about what a splendid time the laugher was having <>
as a critic it is sometimes useful for me to confront how uniquely personal the moviegoing experience can be particularly when it comes to comedy <>
in my world gone fishin was a complete catastrophe <>
in the laughers world it was an unqualified delight <>
{-1} theres certainly nothing inherently clever about the premise <>
joe pesci and danny glover play a couple of lifelong pals named joe waters and gus green who share a love of fishing and a talent for leaving heaping piles of rubble in their wake <>
and that ultimately is what gone fishin is about <>
forget the contest which sends joe and gus to the florida everglades from their new jersey home forget the runins with a creepy con artist nick brimble and the search for his hidden loot forget the cameos by louise fletcher and willie nelson theyll certainly hope you do <>
gone fishin is about boats crashing through plate glass windows exploding gas stations exploding hotel rooms and wild rides on runaway vehicles of every possible kind <>
in other words its in the tradition of the slapsticky liveaction comedies disney made when dean jones and kurt russell were foiling the nefarious schemes of joe flynn and cesar romero in various permutations <>
{-2} at least those concoctions were fastpaced and enthusiastically silly <>
for every two minutes of action in gone fishin there are at least twenty minutes of inane chatter between pesci and glover <>
the two are supposed to be lovable incurably optimistic simpletons but someone forgot to spend any script time on the lovable part <>
joe and gus are dull immature and worst of all they simply refuse to shut up <>
theyre like two longlost howard brothers a pair of stooges whose suburban upbringing bred most of the malice out of them and left them garrulous wellintentioned accidental anarchists <>
{-1} thoughts of the three stooges led me back to the laugher and his enjoyment suddenly made a lot more sense <>
he was laughing at joe and gus because they were losers who managed to take con men and slicktalking salesmen down along with them <>
they were everymen looking for a break but they were also troublemakers <>
they were rebels without a clue making an idlevel connection the way the stooges have made idlevel connections for sixty years <>
its actually a bit of an insult to the stooges to compare them to the ponderous shenanigans of joe and gus except to note that the audience may find the mayhem similarly appealing <>
for the laugher joe and guss adventures were a riotous <>
the less stoogeinclined may consider them nothing but a pair of foreheads waiting for a swinging twobyfour <>
now that would be comedy <>

{-1} i dont even need to have seen the infotainment show interviews of billy crystal and robin williams to know the substance of them <>
well billyrobin would say robinbilly and i have been looking for a long time for a project where we could work together and fathers day seemed like the perfect opportunity <>
yeah robinbilly would then chime in we had a great time making it <>
whereupon would ensue much goodnatured riffing between the two guaranteed to have the hosts chuckling merrily as we returned to the studio <>
for those uninitiated in promospeak allow me to provide a translation <>
the real plot of fathers day has nothing to do with two men attorney jack lawrence crystal and struggling writerperformer dale putley williams who are both told by the same exlover nastassja kinski that one of them is the father of her runaway yearold son scott charlie hofheimer <>
the real plot of fathers day is robin williams and billy crystal running around being robin williams and billy crystal <>
{-2} that plot shouldnt have been too hard to pull off <>
crystal and williams are funny talented men and the screenwriting team of lowell ganz and babaloo mandel has produced charmers like splash parenthood and city slickers <>
fathers day however isnt merely disappointing <>
it is one of the laziest and most ineptly constructed comedies of the decade <>
i spent minutes staring at a screen in blankfaced astonishment waiting for this group of talented people to show me something remotely entertaining <>
i wanted someone anyone to explain to me what in gods name they were thinking when they set this beast in motion <>
{-1} of course i knew the answer to that question <>
they were thinking that they had robin williams and billy crystal and that everything else would just sort itself out <>
fathers day is filled with scenes where it looked like the script consisted of the phrase robin does something crazy here <>
you can see it when williams tries out different ways to greet his newfound son you can see it when williams pretends to be a german record producer for the express purpose of rattling off a string of car names in a funny accent <>
it is the rare film which has made good use of williams improvisational skills good morning vietnam comes to mind <>
more frequently a careless creative team like this one will use williams as a comedic inagaddadavida drum solo filling time between fade in and fade out <>
without a structure to contain him robin williams becomes a train just looking for a place to jump the tracks <>
{-1} crystal isnt even that lucky consigned with the rest of the cast to picking up whatever scraps williams leaves behind <>
he plays the felix unger in this odd couple road show maintaining the same vaguely perturbed expression for roughly the entire film <>
you might think fathers day would be built around the conflict between the opposing personalities of the two leads crystal as the uptight lawyer and williams as the unhinged creative type but youd be wrong <>
williams and crystal hardly raise their voices to one another perhaps fearing that the audience only wants to see them as funny chums <>
the film is so desperate for some kind of conflict that it drags in a couple of drug dealers as well as scotts other father bruce greenwood <>
respectively they provide the opportunity to watch a mosh pit full of headbutting and a portapotty sliding down a hillside <>
thanks for coming <>
{-2} most critics tend to reserve their greatest outrage for films featuring pauly shore chris farley or even jim carrey perhaps believing that moronic physical comedy is whats wrong with modern filmmaking <>
i consider fathers day more contemptible by far <>
whatever else one might think about farley or carrey they give everything theyve got to a role <>
no one involved in fathers day even seems to be trying <>
the performances are lifeless the plot incorporates that overused trope of the workaholic who gets religion about family life and the dialogue is so devoid of creativity that it recycles a gag about the odds of lou gehrig dying of lou gehrigs disease comparative stories about how long ago you first heard that one mailed to this address please <>
im sure the stars had a wonderful time making fathers day just like burt reynolds dom deluise and company had a wonderful time making those cannonball run movies <>
as the credits started to role i began to hope that fathers day would include outtakes something to justify my time <>
they also would have provided a fitting postcard coda for a film which amounts to a working vacation for robin williams and billy crystal at our expense having a good time glad you were there <>

[7391/1]
{-2} heres the good news tom arnold may never ever be allowed to make a movie again after mchales navy <>
heres the bad news everything else <>
mchale follows sgt bilko and down periscope as the best arguments yet for military downsizing trotting out the same tired cliches unorthodox heroes inept commanding officers officious little weasels getting trampled by the zany crew which havent been funny sincewell ever <>
arnold plays quinton mchale the lovable oaf of a retired naval officer who bootlegs but also donates to hospitals and poor kids so we know hes really a standup guy <>
tim curry plays his archenemy who bares his teeth so much that his dentist should get a screen credit <>
curry wants to do somethingorother involving a military satellite and its up to mchales crew to prevent it or at least wander around for a while getting into trouble until the somethingorother doesnt happen <>
if you last the whole minutes you will experience a few explosions a bar fight the visage of ernest borgnine looking as though it were already preserved in formaldehyde kids in peril pigs in peril and the criminal waste of bruce campbells eccentric talents <>
you should also get some sort of pension you may be having flashbacks of this one for years <>

{-2} for the record i dont tend to put much stock in conspiracy theories <>
i dont believe the cia had kennedy killed i dont believe there is a flying saucer hidden somewhere near roswell new mexico and i dont believe that polio vaccinations are part of a secret plot to place tracking devices in our bodies <>
call me a starryeyed optimist if you must but i think people are capable of quite enough selfish nastiness on an individual basis and that that very same selfishness makes cooperative nastiness an endeavor riddled with problems <>
when it comes to hollywood however i might be willing to make an exception <>
studios just may be conspiring to sap from our brains the ability to recognize clumsy stories which make only the faintest sense <>
by comparison to the crimes shadow conspiracy perpetrates on an unsuspecting audience the crimes in its socalled plot seem positively benign <>
{0} charlie sheen stars as bobby bishop a presidential speech writer and advisor on his way up the washington power chain through his deft ability to doctor a spin <>
it is just another day in the capital when a former professor of bobbys theodore bikel meets bobby on the street to warn him of a secret government cabal called shadow just before the professor is shot in the head by a brutal agent stephen lang <>
suddenly bobby finds himself running for his life able to trust only two people jake conrad donald sutherland bobbys mentor and the white house chiefofstaff and amanda givens linda hamilton a reporter and bobbys former girlfriend <>
together they must find out who is behind shadow and what their diabolical plans are <>
{-1} sheen appears to be basing his film career on playing the dupe he was also a patsy sniffing out dirty doings in terminal velocity and the arrival but if he could be suckered into taking on a script like this perhaps hes not doing all that much acting <>
shadow conspiracy credited to the writing tandem of adi hasak and ric gibbs appears to be the product of screenplay software introducing hackneyed situations and characters without enough energy to make the cliches tolerable <>
the hero is established as a cocky smoothtalker but instead of giving him chances to talk himself out of difficult situations the script keeps him perpetually running away from the terminatorlike lang linda hamilton must have been experiencing serious dejavu <>
hamilton acts as the obligatory romantic sparring partner except that bobby and amanda grumble at each other only briefly before settling into a dreary camaraderie <>
the betrayal the chase scene the narrow escapeall the ingredients are there but they sit there flatly without the benefit of a single moment of imagination <>
{-2} if the basic material is bad then the execution is even worse <>
the direction by rambos george p cosmatos and editing by robert a ferretti in shadow conspiracy are inept to a degree that seems almost conspiratorially designed <>
one chase flashes from a luxury hotel to a homeless encampment to a sewer out of les miserables with a blissful disregard for continuity scenes designed for tension become inconsequential blurs and characters wander through the narrative for an hour before you have a clue what they are supposed to be doing <>
cosmatos doesnt even understand basic principles of drama making a point of showing us a trickytounlatch seatbelt which then plays no further part in the story an unfired gun which probably sent chekhov to spinning in his grave <>
shadow conspiracy is the kind of incomprehensible mess where a highly trained agent is willing to run through a hotel and a city street firing a gun in full view of hundreds of witnesses then decides to get secretive by building a remotecontrolled toy helicopter to assassinate the president <>
{-1} that climactic scene at least provides a moment of absurdist fun the only one shadow conspiracy has to offer unless you count the floppy hats hamilton favors which are sure to gain a white house correspondent professional respect <>
mostly it is just a plodding and somber piece of nonsense which seems to expect brownie points for showing us all the ways the government can keep an eye on us and ends with an ominous tracking shot to the perspective of a spy satellite <>
personally i feel more threatened by the prospect of lazy prefabricated thrillers foisted off on the american viewing public as entertainment <>
if the people who brought us shadow conspiracy are supposed to be the ones to shine the light on sinister conspiracies which threaten our freedoms all i have to say is whos watching the watchmen <>

[6685/2]
{-1} dont be misled by advertising which suggests that the relic is some sort of sublimely spooky thriller because it is nothing of the kind <>
if you sit through the film long enough and several people at the screening i attended threw in the towel somewhere before the end of the third reel you many begin to wonder if you have stumbled through a time warp back to the early s when horror films were an excuse to play can you top this with graphic depictions of murders <>
for all its ostensibly classy trappings the relic is simply a mad slasher film with a monster instead of a maniac as relentlessly violent and unpleasant as any film in recent memory <>
{0} in the relic tom sizemore plays chicago homicide detective vincent dagosta who investigates a brazilian cargo ship which drifts into lake michigan with the entire crew brutally murdered and decapitated <>
when a similar murder occurs at the museum of natural history dagosta tries to determine the connection between the two incidents <>
one possibility may be a shipment which arrives at the museum from a field anthropologist a crate containing mysterious leaves <>
when evolutionary biologist margo green penelope ann miller examines the leaves she discovers that the plant may have the contain hormones which cause extreme mutations in whatever consumes it <>
this discovery may come too late however as the museum prepares to hold a gala benefit which may end with several guests lacking much above their black ties <>
{-1} if you saw wes cravens current horror homagesatire scream you are acquainted with the rules of horror films if you didnt see scream you can learn most of them from the relic <>
the likelihood of any given character to die is proportional to his or her demonstrated vices so you can bank on the fact that a security guard who lights up a joint is not long for this world nor is a notable nasty like the obnoxious scientist chi moui lo who threatens to steal away dr greens research grant <>
splitting up a group is also a sure sign of carnage to come especially if one person alone is carrying a flashlight or investigating any sort of strange noise <>
you can also count on at least one startled animal to provide a gratuitous shock to the system to be followed closely by something genuinely horrifying <>
{-1} these elements are familiar for some bad reasons usually laziness but also for the good reason that when put to good use they can be part of a truly tense film <>
the original alien was a classic bug hunt crafted with such style by ridley scott that everything old seemed new again <>
peter hyams pretends to be interested in that kind of primal chiller but he has neither the patience nor the skill for it <>
the multiattributed script tosses personality quirks at its character hoping something might stick but only audra lindley as an acerbic coroner seems remotely human <>
more often the script resorts to exposition enhancers like the two kids who turn up to ask what millers character does for a living theres nothing like turning a screenplay into a catechism to make sure no one is confused <>
hyams who has always acted as his own cinematographer shoots everything with as little light as possible clearly under the impression that atmosphere can be manipulated with a dimmer switch meanwhile the last half of the relic is edited with a gross disregard for anything resembling building tension <>
the relic just gets louder darker and more hectic with each passing minute as hyams repeatedly confuses murky with moody <>
{-2} there is also something terribly dishonest about the way the relic is shot because there is virtually nothing creepy about it <>
the old slasher films of the s had no pretensions about what they were there to show the audience when someone was going to die a horrible death they turned up all the lights and showed you a horrible death <>
there are easily a dozen severed heads which roll through the minutes of the relic and people are torn apart with such regularity during the last minutes that it no longer matters how quickly the light shines on the corpse or how rapid the edit is <>
hyams finally shows his hand in a sequence where a swat team enters the museum in an attempt to rescue trapped patrons <>
the first man drops in on a rope and is promptly drawn and quartered a second man drops in after him and is separated from his head quite graphically is snipped in half below the waist <>
at that point the relic becomes a turkey shoot where so many anonymous individuals are killed that the survival of the two main protagonists doesnt matter <>
the relic is an ugly and stupid film which is bad enough <>
it also proves to be a terribly dehumanizing one <>
special effects wizard stan winston might have created a nifty creature to trot out for the climax but for all it mattered to the story hyams might as well have saved the budget and used a guy in a hockey mask <>

[6317/1]
{-2} it is a tough call which annoying trend represented by mad dog time is more annoying <>
is it the cameorama the insistence upon turning every scene into a celebrity wheres waldo <>
or is it the pulp affliction the impression that a film spilling over with kooky garrulous gangsters must also be spilling over with style points <>
writerdirector larry bishop has a terrible case of both in mad dog time a simply awful piece of pseudocool tripe which holds the ignominious distinction of being the heir apparent to things to do in denver when youre dead as film most likely to make you wish no aspiring director had ever seen a quentin tarantino film <>
{0} jeff goldblum stars as mickey holiday a hired gun with more enemies than he can count <>
as if it werent bad enough that everyone who can pull a trigger wants to challenge him to a quickdraw contest mickey now faces the return of his former boss vic richard dreyfuss a big shot who has been spending some time in a mental hospital <>
it seems vic is likely to be unhappy that mickey hooked up with vics girl grace diane lane while he was away even though mickey is now involved with graces sister rita ellen barkin <>
vic however faces problems of his own from rivals who think the time is right to move in on his territory rivals including jake kyle maclachlan and ben london gabriel byrne <>
vics solution to all his problems is nick falco larry bishop a cool gunman more than capable of dispatching each and every one of vics enemies <>
{-2} bishop the son of comic joey bishop clearly wanted to take a contemporary crime caper and mix it with the swingin sensibility of his dads old rat pack buddies <>
the soundtrack is spilling over with s and s standards including a couple by the chairman of the board himself and everyone walks around in tuxedos for the gents or slinky evening dresses for the dames radiating smoothness <>
however in trying to combine oceans eleven with reservoir dogs bishop has cranked out a script with so much utterly ridiculous dialogue that you might not even notice that you dont care a thing about anyone or anything in mad dog time <>
gabriel byrne is the worst offender trying to make his irish accent sound like brooklyn italian while blathering on about other characters in lines which mistake simple inane rhymes and alliteration for cleverness <>
there is an almost hypnotic monotony to the artificial cadence of the speech in mad dog time after a while it begins to sound like it was written by the rrated evil twin of dr seuss <>
{-2} with nothing to say and a truly grating way of saying it bishop resorts to trotting out cameos of guys who dont seem to belong on the same planet let alone in the same movie <>
billy idol and gregory hines joey bishop and burt reynolds paul anka and richard pryor whose appearance seems not only unnecessary but just plain cruel <>
bishop even goes for obscurity points by bringing in oceans eleven cast member henry silva as a narcoleptic hood and flashinthepan christopher jones of wild in the streets as one of goldblums challengers <>
it doesnt matter that none of them has anything to do except show off a skin tone which whether natural or induced by lighting or makeup makes many of them look like prime candidates for the george hamilton memorial melanoma wing of cedarssinai <>
even the notoriously bronzed goldblum looks like a british schoolboy next to the burnt sienna complexion of anka reynolds and bishop himself <>
{-2} at times bishop seems to be making a desperate attempt to convince the audience that he is aware of the ludicrous excesses in mad dog time giving goldblum a couple of metaconscious lines which refer to characters situations or dialogue <>
there are even a couple of moderately inspired moments like having dreyfuss and reynolds owners of two of the most distinctive laughs in hollywood cackling away as they face each other <>
but when a filmmaker spends this much time subjecting viewers to a story which exists only as a place to put his obnoxious rat pack standins and have them mouth labored grossly unfunny lines he loses the right to pretend its all a lark <>
the actors may have had fun playing versions of frankie sammy dean and the boys but that fun isnt likely to be shared by an audience <>
mad dog time is a selfindulgent homage masquerading as hipster cinema <>
worse yet its like the cannonball run with cocktails and sharkskin <>

[5931/2]
{-2} the advertising campaign for the crow city of angels invites us to believe in the power of another but it sounds more like a plea for sympathy <>
after all what are you supposed to do when you want to make a sequel but the star of the first film is no longer with us <>
well i suppose the obvious answer swallow your checkbook and allow the crow to rest in peace was unacceptable but this is one sequel which seemed utterly doomed from the first minute <>
s the crow was a film with a striking look but it owed virtually every ounce of emotional resonance it had to the tragic death of star brandon lee while filming the scene in which his character is killed <>
city of angels has no such back story to prop up its retread of the first film and seems determined to substitute excess for emotion in what has to rank as one of the years most grueling cinematic ordeals <>
{0} the setting is the near future in the city of angels where a drug lord named judah earl richard brooks controls all <>
it is the misfortune of a mechanic named ash vincent perez and his young son to witness a gang of judahs thugs murdering someone and they in turn are murdered as well <>
but a little thing like death cant keep ash down not when he becomes one with the vengeanceminded spirit of the crow <>
he befriends a tattoo artist named sarah mia kirshner but he has little time to spend on relationships <>
his mission is to find the people responsible for his sons death including judah himself and destroy them so that his soul might find peace <>
{-1} if there is anyone you should really feel sorry for in this mess it is vincent perez because i dont think he ever had a chance <>
this isnt like val kilmer stepping into batmans boots or pierce brosnan taking over as its more like someone trying to replace patrick stewart as captain picard <>
the crows fans are passionate about the film and in particular about the man they see as headed towards stardom before he was cut down in his prime <>
perez has the right look for the part he looks serviceably eerie in the crows face paint and leather duster but hes not brandon lee <>
thats not even a criticism because im not convinced lee was anything that special <>
the point is that those who come to this film because they loved the crow are going to have a real problem with this guy with a french accent taking over for their hero <>
{-2} then again i suppose perez always could have said no especially once he got a look at a script which has him making his entrance emerging from a fountain of water in tattered clothes looking like esther williams on the way to a rave <>
there is plenty of silliness like that in city of angels it tries to stake a claim to mythopoetic status by including a tiresiaslike blind seer but mostly it is an empty recycling of the crow <>
the radical switch involves having the dead man avenging a son rather than a lover but otherwise it simply finds a different leatherclad fellow killing his own killers one by one and oh the time and energy exerted on finding creative methods of inflicting pain <>
the bill of fare in city of angels includes a hypodermic needle jammed up a nose a tattoo needle applied to the eyeball eyes gouged out and even a tortured crow dont worry no animals were harmed in the making of this film <>
its a resolutely ugly film director tim pope has put together heavy on gratuitous sm but light on any semblance of a point <>
sarah we assume this is the skatepunk from the first film all grown up serves only to give us the lovely mia kirshner to look at and pope appears far more concerned with serving up candlewaxonthenipples than creating characters <>
{-2} there are plenty of individual reasons to avoid city of angels though iggy pop makes an ideal villain for the crow since he looks like a corpse himself but its much simpler to explain why each category of potential viewer should stay away <>
if you did not see the first film you probably have no interest in a dark story of vengeance with plenty of unpleasantness <>
if you saw the first film and did not like it expect more of the same in city of angels only less compelling less artistic and more obsessed with music video theatrics <>
and if you saw the first film and did like it do the memory of brandon lee a great honor and do not let his death provide a producer with an excuse to build a franchise this awful on his grave <>

[5820/1]
{-2} quick match the psychotic robert deniro character to the film in which he appears travis bickleall right that was a gimme how about max cady or rupert pupkin <>
it seems that deniro has played an inordinate number of nut cases but each one has been a distinct creation <>
it also seems less than coincidental that all of the aforementioned roles in taxi driver cape fear and the king of comedy respectively were directed by martin scorsese <>
scorsese knows deniro well enough and has enough talent to refuse to let him lapse into selfparody <>
tony scott on both counts does not <>
the fan is an piece of hack work in which everyone involved flounders in a pointless story made even more intolerable by scotts oppressive atmospheric theatrics <>
{0} deniro plays gil renard a divorced hunting supplies salesman and lifelong san francisco giants fan <>
gil is particularly excited about the upcoming season because the giants have signed reigning league mvp bobby rayburn wesley snipes as a free agent to join established team star juan primo benicio del toro <>
unfortunately gil is a bit too devoted to baseball in fact he is an unhinged obsessive and when he loses both his job and visitation rights with his son he buries himself even deeper in the game <>
when rayburn goes into a prolonged slump gil begins to feel that there is a connection between them and decides to take action to help him <>
that action does end up connecting the two men a connection which doesnt make rayburn too thrilled about getting up close and personal with his fans <>
{-2} it saddens me to announce the return of the tony scott responsible for days of thunder and beverly hills cop ii after a brief hiatus during which he channeled brother ridley to produce the tense and claustrophobic crimson tide <>
this is the tony scott who has ingested the simpsonbruckheimer visual motif to such an extent that he seems medically dependent on the kind of lighting which makes everyone in the film look like george hamilton this is the tony scott whom one suspects might never have been able to set up a shot he liked if blinds had not been invented <>
scott is a director who generally takes a script actors and solid production values and grinds them into hamburger to be smothered in slow motion and a spiritcrushing soundtrack <>
whatever substance their might have been in the story of the fan is rendered toxic by contact with scotts vision <>
this is an ugly ugly film <>
{-1} there is no great challenge involved in figuring out what the psychological underpinnings of this story were supposed to be and that they might actually have made a decent film in some alternate reality <>
we are meant to see gil as a beatendown everyman whose desire for a life where he is noticed drives him to an ultimately violent fascination with the celebrity he idolizes sort of a hybrid of willie lohman and charles manson <>
but the sympathetic side of gil never comes through he is frightening and crazy when we meet him and it is obvious that he has been frightening and crazy for some time from the reactions of his boss and exwife <>
bobby rayburn is sane but screenwriter phoef sutton fumbles any development in his character <>
the arrogant but superstitious superstar has a life which parallels gils in ways so obvious that you can feel the elbow in your ribs a divorce a young son a perfectionist streak driven by their fathers etc but beyond those bits of trivia there is nothing to him <>
wesley snipes looks leaden most of the time trying to find some kind of emotional core which just isnt there and scotts direction steadfastly refuses to allow him the faintest hope of doing so <>
{-2} snipes is in trouble from the start with a character who makes no sense but at least you might hope for some creative lunacy from deniro <>
sadly what emerges instead is a performance which slaps together pieces of his superior work for scorsese <>
like travis bickle he is a loner lacking social skills living a kind of double life like rupert pupkin he uses his idol to get his shot at fame like max cady he is violent and uses the child of his nemesis to get even <>
in the twenty years since taxi driver everyone who fancies himself an impressionist has done a lazy deniro impression by squinting and rasping you talkin to me <>
its depressing to see deniro doing his own impression of himself <>
{-2} the fan is the kind of film which makes me angry enough to point out idiotic inconsistencies like overhead shots of candlestick now com park which obviously were taken at er games but the fact is that i dont need to <>
it is a film lacking a single character with whom to identify without a single shot which doesnt remind you that its director cares more about the filter he has chosen than he does about his characters <>
thats right tony scottim talkin to you <>

see ive got coolio to do a song for the soundtrack and about fifty athletes and celebrities to do cameo appearances <>
its about professional basketball so ill release it right around the nba finals to guarantee added publicity <>
as for what the movie is actually aboutwell that will all sort itself out eventually <>
i figure it will be a comedy so ill throw a halfdozen writers at it and take the best of whatever they come up with <>
maybe well put a gender spin on it see if we can get some women out to see it too <>
{-2} eddie is one of those phenomenally lazy films that infuriates me more than any other kind <>
twister as inane as the script might have been at least required some creative technicians mission impossible overwrought plot and all at least involved genuine effort <>
eddie just sits there hawking up a formula story without any laughs and makes every possible bad decision when a decision is required <>
{0} whoopi goldberg plays eddie franklin a new york limo driver and diehard knicks fan who is suffering through a dismal season for her beloved team <>
coach john bailey dennis farina has lost control of his overpaid prima donnas and the losses are beginning to mount <>
the dwindling attendance inspires new team owner wild bill burgess frank langella to try a publicity stunt in which a lucky fan will get to be an honorary coach of the team <>
the winner surprise surprise is eddie who becomes a fan favorite and eventually the actual coach <>
the knicks continue to lose but eddie has some sassy tricks up her sleeve to inspire her troops <>
{-2} incidentally the knicks eventually start winning <>
please raise your hand if that comes as a shock and i will invite you to my allnight marathon of the bad news bears major league angels in the outfield the mighty ducks the big green cool runnings and little giants <>
awful teams in sports comedies make miraculous turnarounds its what they do <>
those teams usually involve kids for a very sound comedic reason its funnier when they screw up and theyre more sympathetic <>
those which dont involve kids usually have actual actors in the lead roles for another very sound comedic reason they generally have developed some sort of comic timing <>
eddie was cast under the misguided premise that its easier to make basketball players look like actors than it is to make actors look like basketball players <>
this finds nba players like greg ostertag dwayne schintzius rick fox and malik sealy delivering punch lines as though they were reading them for the first time off a bazooka wrapper though sacramento kings center olden polynice has a nice moment describing a black hole to fellow players <>
{-2} perhaps that all didnt matter to anyone because there are so few punch lines and because the whole film is one big casting gimmick <>
steve rash directs the spiritless script as though waving a flag of surrender and screaming dont blame me i just work here <>
perhaps it was patently obvious to him that eddie isnt a movie its a cameo appearance that trips over a plot every once in a while <>
among the notables who lend their faces to this travesty are donald trump new york mayor rudolph giulianni former new york mayor ed koch david letterman letterman regulars mujibur rahman and sirajul islam espn broadcaster chris berman and knicks announcer marv albert as well as dozens of nba players and several nba arenas <>
and those are the real jokes in eddie <>
nothing these individuals say or do is funny you are supposed to be laughing simply because you notice hey its donald trump or hey its mujibur and sirajul <>
{-2} its difficult to decide whether eddie is so bad because it was so shamelessly lacking in imagination or because it cant even get the cliches in a clicheridden genre script right <>
the knicks coach who is eddies antagonist early in the film reappears at the end but he isnt given a chance to be the villain eddie desperately needs <>
neither is frank langella and none of the athleteactors have the ability to give whoopi goldberg anything to play off of <>
that leaves her to do her streetwise miss thang routine but with no character no sharp lines and no help <>
{-2} eddie isnt just a bad movie with a formulaic premise <>
its a movie that makes you feel cheated and offended because someone came up with a poster and a marketing plan to which they had to attach an actual movie and you had the nerve to believe it was going to be a comedy <>

{-2} lorne michaels must die it is really as simple as that <>
yes he bought himself a temporary reprieve with the dumbbutstill funny tommy boy but michaels has foisted so much horrible product on american television and film audiences in the last five years that such a minor success was the artistic equivalent of charles manson buying a few boxes of girl scout cookies <>
we can only find evidence of a benevolent god in the fact that hans franz the movie and coffee talk the movie were scrapped in development that is not a joke <>
unfortunately stuart saves his family slipped out before paramount stopped handing michaels blank checks <>
not only is this latest saturday night live character spinoff incoherent and unfunny its basic idea and tone are just appallingly wrongheaded <>
{0} al franken stars as stuart smalley caring nurturer and host of the public access cable program daily affirmation <>
that is before the program is cancelled leading stuart into a shame spiral which causes concern among his cadre of step sponsors led by julia laura san giacomo <>
to make matters worse the death of a beloved aunt forces stuart to confront his singularly dysfunctional immediate family his alcoholic father harris yulin codependent enabler mother shirley knight potsmoking unemployed brother vincent donofrio overeater and thricedivorced sister lesley boone <>
as family strife commences over trouble with the aunts inheritance stuart tries to be the peacemaker while also trying to revive his show on another cable network <>
{-1} to state the obvious about the recent spate of snlinspired features the fiveminute sketches on which stuart saves his family is based werent all that funny to begin with <>
they had their moments primarily because al franken is one of the few performers associated with snl in the last decade who doesnt appear to have had all his subtlety surgically removed indeed his singsong delivery is good for the films few laughs <>
but where on earth was he going to come up with a minute concept for a movie <>
the answer is that he didnt <>
instead he took two minute concepts and fused them together into a disastrous whole <>
one plot in which stuart attempts to take his illinois public access show to the big time shades of waynes world anyone is supposed to be the funny part <>
it is not with the exception of a cameo by julia its pat sweeney as a timid receptionist who becomes a guest on daily affirmation <>
mostly its just deadly slow <>
{-2} what is unintentionally funny about stuart saves his family is the movieoftheweek melodrama of the smalley family segments <>
although there are a few flashbacks to stuarts youth which are played strictly for laughs unsuccessfully the majority of the interactions are intended to be poignant or serious <>
this decision is baffling because franken appears to have forgotten the premise behind the daily affirmation sketches <>
they were parodies of the touchyfeely selfhelp movement deriving most of their humor from goofy overreliance on new age mantras like stuarts ubiquitous and thats okay <>
but stuart saves his family is practically a love letter to selfhelp and the problems within the family are treated with a ridiculous earnestness <>
the schizoid combination of humorless comedy and misplaced sentimentality including a score by the evermoresaccharine marc shaiman makes for a truly uncomfortable ride <>
{-2} it is clear that al franken had two basic choices when it came to making a stuart movie keep stuart a caricature in an episodic story or make him more real in an actual narrative <>
he managed somehow to get harold ramis groundhog day to direct so he went for the human feelgood angle <>
big mistake <>
{-2} i said franken had two basic choices make that three he could have chosen not to do the movie at all that would have been the smart choice <>

[3455/2]
{-2} gnaw on this factoid for a moment bad boys was originally a project with dana carvey slated to play one of the leads <>
that is not a misprint dana carvey <>
and if you think about it long enough you will realize why bad boys never had a prayer of being anything more than mediocre and in fact turned out quite bad <>
it is the classic case of a shell plot intended to do nothing more than showcase the stars familiar comic routine <>
bad boys is an amazingly boring action film and will be funny only to fans of martin lawrence andor will smith <>
{0} lawrence and smith play marcus burnett and mike lowry two miami narcotics officers with very different personalities <>
marcus is a home body with a wife theresa randle and three kids mike is a player with a steady stream of lady friends <>
they do share a problem howevera fortune in heroin from one of their busts which has been stolen from the police station by mastermind fouchet tcheky karyo <>
the case becomes complicated when a witness tea leoni to a pair of murders committed by fouchet and his goons calls for help setting in motion a sequence of events in which marcus is forced to pretend he is mike <>
meanwhile both mike and marcus try to track down fouchet before he resells the heroin to mobsters <>
{-2} ill tell you exactly what kind of movie bad boys is <>
it is the kind of movie where anything that can blow up will blow up <>
it is the kind of movie where glass exists solely to be shattered either by bullets or by bodies in one hilariously idiotic example a glass aquarium is mounted in the wall of a nightclub allowing a convenient view of the inside of the mens room as well as providing a readymade breakable item <>
it is the kind of movie where a misinterpreted phone conversation turns into an episode of threes company <>
and it is the kind of movie where a guy in a wheelchair gets knocked over by the villain just so you know that hes really a villain he probably doesnt recycle either <>
in short it is a collection of every conceivable action film cliche right down to the highstrung police captain an incessantly screaming joe pantoliano <>
{-2} dont expect much better from the characters <>
martin lawrence has the role with the most potential the family man playing the part of the sexy bachelor but he completely butchers it <>
the part requires someone capable of a little restraint someone who appears uncomfortable acting smooth and seductive <>
that someone is not lawrence who is full of swagger and attitude <>
falling back on his popular standup and sitcom persona might prove popular with his diehard fans but others will wonder exactly how he is supposed to be different from mike <>
marcus is a part that actually requires some acting ability and martin lawrence doesnt have much <>
will smith does have acting ability and plenty of it but he really takes a back seat to lawrence <>
when he is allowed to show his frustration with the mess lawrence is making of his house and his image smith is quite good and there is actually some energy in bad boys <>
those occasions however are all too rare <>
{-2} the simple truth is that basically bad boys is trying to showcase lawrence and smith the way beverly hills cop showcased eddie murphy and a coherent plot would just get in the way of the jokes <>
there are clearly a lot of people who think martin lawrence is funny but i am not one of them <>
it is just depressing watching him bug his eyes at the suggestion that he is gay or fumbling for an explanation when his wife catches him in a lie which incidentally exists only as a lame plot device <>
while will smith can be quite funny he becomes something of a straight man to lawrence and that is a real misuse of his talents <>
bad boys is a generic action flick full of pointless slowmotion shots by director michael bay and heavy use of orange filters by cinematographer howard atherton sporadically interrupted by lawrence and smiths profane version of the traditional buddy film odd couple <>
bad boys even worse movie <>

[3285/0]
{-2} there is a regular feature in sports illustrated magazine devoted to examples of astounding stupidity <>
it is titled this weeks sign that the apocalypse is upon us <>
that phrase kept running through my head as i sat through the jerky boys <>
somehow two obnoxious losers had managed to parlay a fascination with juvenile humor and prank phone calls into an incredibly popular pair of audio releases and a movie deal <>
for irritating people they were being rewarded in the millions of dollars <>
and the worst thing is none of it is funny <>
the jerky boys is a terrible idea badly executed <>
and it will undoubtedly be extremely profitable <>
{0} the jerky boys are johnny johnny brennan and kamal kamal ahmed a pair of unemployed buddies still living with their mothers in queens ny with all the time on their hands the boys enjoy running up hefty beer tabs and making wacky prank phone calls <>
one of these calls is made to organized crime boss ernie lazarro alan arkin with the boys claiming to be mafia big shots from chicago <>
when lazarro learns that they arent who they claim to be they find themselves on the run from lazarros goons as well as from the local cop brad sullivan who over hears the phone call and believes that they boys really are with the mob <>
{-2} let us begin here the idea of building a movie around prank phone calls is somewhat mindboggling to begin with <>
the jerky boys is full of shots of phones ringing of stationary speaker phones of people talking on the phone <>
im hardpressed to think of any way such a format could have been turned into riveting cinema <>
then again the jerky boys never had to be riveting cinema <>
this is a movie about one thing giving two idiots a chance to do their schtick which consists entirely of insults threats and silly voices <>
there are a bunch of absurd setups which are designed to get the boys on a phone an intercom or a dispatch radio where they each display their gift for two voices johnny is either a nasal grouch or a nasal whiner kamal either a babbling immigrant or a snarling authority figure <>
in a strange way its a little like the old elvis presley movies in which it didnt matter what was going on in the plot as long as elvis got a chance to sing <>
that was what the people were coming for <>
{-2} but for people coming to the jerky boys expecting the same thing they heard on their bestselling cds they arent going to get it <>
i have listened to the jerky boys cd and i think it is spectacularly unfunny but there could be some minor entertainment value in the befuddled reactions of the recipients of the calls <>
of course that simply is not possible in a movie everyone is in on the gag so you end up with a lot of reaction shots of actors fuming in mock frustration <>
and there are few things sadder than the fact that one of those actors is alan arkin <>
{-2} much has been and will be written about the jerky boys as not simply a bad movie but as part of a horrible trend the logical successor if logical is the word i want to use to the popularity of dumb and dumber beavis and butthead and the like <>
not only does treating the jerky boys in this way give it far more sociological importance than it deserves it insults those other examples by comparison <>
as bad as dumb and dumber was at least someone was trying as stupid as beavis and butthead can be at least they are rooted in satire <>
the jerky boys is simply junior high school humor aimed at junior high schoolers <>
it is aimed squarely at those who are guaranteed to burst into uproarious and selfrighteous laughter at swishy gay stereotypes and copious expletives <>
if hearing someone intone the word liverlips several times is your idea of yuks galore then by all means toss your into the jerky boys coffers <>
i suspect few moviegoers old enough to get into this movie legally will waste their money or their time <>

[3251/8]
{1} maybe its envy maybe its years of hollywood trying to sell every pretty boy or gorgeous girl as the next big thing and maybe its some combination of the two <>
for whatever reason both moviegoers and critics alike seem to have incredible difficulty acknowledging that attractiveness and talent could go hand in hand <>
paul newman was nearly sixt before it became widely acknowledged that there was more to this guy than his famous blue eyes he could actually act <>
when he won as best actor in for the color of money it was widely considered a lifetime achievement award but apparently newman had at least one more trick up his sleeve nobodys fool a small quiet drama driven by newmans delightfully weathered lead performance <>
{0} newman plays donald sully sullivan an oftenunemployed construction worker living in the sleepy upstate new york town of north bath <>
after suffering an onthejob knee injury sullys days are largely spent playing poker bantering with his landlady jessica tandy and trying to squeeze some compensation out of the construcion companys owner carl roebuck bruce willis <>
but during this holiday season there are other opportunities <>
in town for thanksgiving is sullys son peter dylan walsh a son hes had an uneasy relationship with since sully left the family when peter was a baby <>
peter is having marital troubles of his own and when peter stays in town with his own son sully has the chance to look back on his life and begin to take on some degree of responsibility for it <>
{1} writerdirector robert benton has a gift for making lowkey relationshipbased films kramer vs kramer places in the heart and nobodys fool is a worthy heir to that tradition <>
benton uses his snowcovered locations beautifully practically turning north bath into one of the characters in the story <>
in many ways nobodys fool is as much about north bath as it is about sully <>
this is a town where everyone really does know everyone else where local disputes are settled by a judge philip bosco who addresses people by their first names and where a guy like sully to all outward appearances a loser in life is still treated with a basic respect for his independent mind <>
when a local banker attempts to bring a theme park to north bath it is a demonstration of a fundamental misunderstanding of what the town is about a sense of family <>
{1} that connectedness makes the relationships between characters in nobodys fool a rare joy <>
there is not a meanspirited moment to be found because even the characters who dont get along treat each other as fellow humans <>
sullys feud with carl is one of the few external conflicts in the film manifested primarily in a game of stealing a snowblower back and forth but even that exchange is essentially goodhumored <>
its one of the things that makes sully so appealing as a character as ornery as he can be he always treats people decently <>
his paternal relationship with sadsack coworker rub pruitt taylor vince is a pleasure to watch unfold and a simple moment when sully helps a senile older woman back to her home is handled without an ounce of condescension <>
its ironicand perhaps part of the point of nobodys foolthat the one relationship which seems forced is that between sully and peter <>
still theres something strangely satisfying about a meeting between an estranged father and son which doesnt include a shouting match or tears <>
{2} however the main reason sully is so appealing is paul newman <>
he has reached a point in his career where he doesnt really play characters any more instead he slips into them like the flannel shirts sully favors <>
that is in no way meant to belittle what newman does as an actor <>
the fact is that he makes it all look effortless as though hes really been sully all his life and someone just happened to turn the camera on at this moment <>
the background for the character an abusive father his own abandonment of his family seems almost tacked on so the movie seems to be about something more but newman doesnt really need it <>
what we are watching is the story of a man who is somehow coming to terms with all the choices he has made in his life and choosing to move forward rather than stand in place <>
its newmans gift that he can do all that with a wellplaced sigh and a twinkle in those eyes <>

[3118/8]
{1} john dahl has to be considered one of the most unlikely success stories of recent years <>
last year his madeforcable film red rock west found a second life in a few art houses around the country and became something of a cult hit <>
the last seduction also made its first appearance on cable earlier this year but from the looks of things dahl will be able to make a few films directly for the big screen if he so chooses <>
film noir has been a hot genre lately and few directors with more established reputations are making them better than john dahl <>
the last seduction is a wonderfully nasty piece of work sparked by linda fiorentinos badtothebone lead performance <>
{0} fiorentino plays bridget gregory a new york city telemarketing manager with ambition and attitude <>
after her husband clay bill pullman a shady doctor scores selling pharmaceutical cocaine to pay off a loan shark bridget takes the money and runs <>
she ends up in beston an upstate town too small for her big plans but shes forced to stay put to avoid being found by clay <>
in beston bridget hooks up with mike swale peter berg an earnest young fellow who falls hard for her <>
with mike in the palm of her hand and clay and his detectives hot on her trail bridget sets in motion a convoluted plan manipulating everyone and everything in her way <>
{1} the critical error many recent film noir attempts have made the abysmal color of night comes most quickly to mind is that they operate on the premise that all you need are minimalist lighting and a few plot twists to maintain audience interest <>
characters become props holding up a plot rather than the elements that drive the plot <>
dahl and screenwriter steve barancik do not make that error <>
everything revolves around the interactions between bridget clay and mike and all three are wellconstructed characters <>
bill pullman who has been making a career out of playing the spurned nice guy sleepless in seattle malice takes on the role of spurned notsoniceguy clay and attacks it with gusto <>
his seething disgust at having underestimated bridget once becomes a fierce determination to get back at her but he is completely unprepared for the lengths to which shell go <>
peter berg is excellent as the bighearted smalltown boy who longs to break free to the big time and latches on to his love for bridget as his best chance to motivate himself after a disastrous first attempt to leave beston <>
in order for the last seduction to work to the fullest berg has to convince us that theres a reason besides simple naivete that he stays with bridget and he makes mikes need genuine <>
{2} however everyone else is just renting screen time from linda fiorentino she owns the show <>
her bridget is a creature of pure ego and ambition and as such there is always the chance that she might seem beyone accepting as a real person <>
occasionally that seems to be the case <>
because barancik deliberately avoids providing us with any easy motivation for bridgets actions a troubled childhood for example her calculation becomes a bit difficult to swallow in one gulp <>
but fiorentino is so alive in this part that she makes bridget real and her glee is infectuous <>
she is at her best when using stereotypical assumptions about women to her advantage such as a scene where she brings cookies out to the detective who is keeping an eye on her so that she can plant nails under his tires or one where she convinces mike that she loves him by plainting a note showing his name in a little heart for him to find <>
bridgets most valuable asset is that nobody quite believes that she can be as amoral as she seems and consequently she is able to catch everyone at their most vulnerable <>
{0} the last seductions plot does have the requisite twists turns and surprises but none of them are particularly jawdropping <>
dahl and barancik are more concerned with tone and character and deliver in both categories <>
but if there is one aspect of the story which is truly impressive it is what doesnt happen <>
the formulaic qualities of so many movies have conditioned us to expect a comeuppance for characters like bridget at a specific plot point however at crucial moments when it seems that shes made a critical mistake shes still one step ahead <>
clockwork plots like the last seduction can sometimes seem too contrived for their own good and some viewere might find it simply too cold <>
many others will find fiorentino and the last seduction the perfect antidote to the recent glut of stylish but vacuous blockbusters <>

[3046/8]
{0} over the last few years no filmmakers work has been linked as closely to his personal life as woody allens has been <>
s husbands and wives focused on troubled marriages and showed allens character infatuated with a much younger woman the parallels to allens life were hard to ignore <>
last years manhattan murder mystery was the kind of light comedy allen hadnt made in years and seemed to indicate a desire to return to simpler times <>
bullets over broadway is another comedy but its no pure lark <>
hilarious as it is its also a sly bit of selfmockery an indication that allen the artist acknowledges the foibles of allen the man <>
{0} set in prohibitionera new york bullets over broadway is the story of david shayne john cusack an earnest young playwright whose two previous flops are making it difficult for him to find backing for his latest play god of our fathers <>
an opportunity presents itself when mobster nick valenti joe viterelli offers to provide all necessary backing for the play provided one of the roles goes to his talentless wouldbe actress girlfriend olive jennifer tilly <>
david is consumed by the idea that he has sold out but the worst is yet to come <>
as rehearsals progress it becomes clear that there are problems with the play and the solutions come from an unlikely source olives bodyguard cheech chazz palminteri <>
{2} those who found they needed dramamine to cope with the hyperkinetic camera movement in husbands and wives and manhattan murder mystery will be delighted to learn that allen lays off the handheld <>
in fact his direction seems a bit too constrained at times as though the theater itself were creating a kind of claustrophobia <>
but while this is far from allens best work as a director his script cowritten by douglas mcgrath is fantastic <>
the dialogue contains as many laughoutloud lines as any film this year and the plot takes at least one twist so delightfully unexpected that its revelation may provide the single biggest laugh <>
in a year woefully short on good comedies bullets over broadway may be a saving grace <>
{2} as usual allen has a marvelous ensemble cast at his disposal to bring his script to life though not all are equally wellused <>
jim broadbent and tracey ullman as two of the plays cast members are basically onenote types john cusack has some marvelous early scenes as he realizes the kind of person he is dealing with in nick but his character gets lost in the shuffle a bit <>
jennifer tilly however is dead solid perfect as the simpleminded olive and rob reiner has a wonderful bit part as a pretentious playwright who takes great pride in the fact that both intellectuals and common people find his plays completely impenetrable <>
but the two showcase roles belong to dianne wiest and chazz palminteri <>
as helen sinclair the plays haughty star wiest brings down the house with her manipulations of david to spice up her character and her cry of dont speak palminteri is even better as cheech a career hood who discovers his latent talent and that hell do anything to protect his creation <>
its a wonderful subtle performance worthy of oscar consideration <>
{1} yet beneath all the laughs in bullets over broadway is a moral question framed by the reiner characters hypothetical question of which you would save from a burning building the last copy of shakespeares works or some anonymous person <>
the artist creates his own moral universe he says but the turns of the story work against that notion <>
better to be a good man than a great artist allen seems to argue and its difficult not to read that thesis as a minor mea culpa for his tabloidheadline exploits <>
in the course of exorcising some of his own demons accompanied by a laugh track allen has created one of his post purely entertaining films in years <>

[3031/2]
{-1} if you have not already done so please add to your list of movie cliches the psychiatristpsychologist who is as screwed up as anyone heshe is treating <>
while some might argue and suicide statistics might support that this is a case of art imitating life it is becoming far too predictable to toss a psychiatrist with personal demons into a suspense plot as flavoring they are the msg of the psychological thriller <>
surely theres a happy welladjusted shrink out there somewhere <>
well not in silent fall and the inclusion of that tired standby is just one of the many many things wrong with this goodlooking but gimmicky thriller <>
{0} the psychiatrist is dr jake rainer richard dreyfuss an expert in autism who has given up his treatment of children in the wake of a patients death <>
he is called in by the local sheriff j t walsh when the only witness to the murder of a prominent couple appears to be their autistic son tim ben faulkner <>
with the assistance of tims sister sylvie liv tyler jake attempts to reconstruct what happened the night of the murders before tim is turned over to a less compassionate psychiatrist john lithgow for more radical treatment <>
their best shot tims uncanny ability to remember and mimic conversations <>
{-2} i dont think im breaking any new ground when i say that richard dreyfuss talented though he may be is a ham <>
and if there is anything more unintentionally amusing than watching a ham act it is watching him try desperately not to be a ham <>
in silent fall director bruce beresford has dreyfuss wandering around in a daze of what is supposed to be selfpity but instead looks mostly like a particularly bad hamlet <>
in the one scene where dreyfuss plays dreyfuss rattling off multiple voices in an attempt to calm tim its almost a relief <>
unfortunately that is the level at which beresford has everyone pitch the performances you only know theyre alive because they blink <>
linda hamilton energetic star of the terminator films has the appallingly underwritten role of jakes ohsosupportive wife who struggles with dialogue like youre the one hiding from the world jake <>
liv tyler daughter of aerosmiths steven tyler in her first major role is lovely but lacks any screen presence and her big emotional scenes are truly laughable <>
from start to finish silent fall is just so sluggish that i felt i was being hypnotized <>
{-2} its even harder to stay awake once you realize the preposterous story that you are being asked to swallow <>
first of all no one from social services ever appears to guard tims interests allowing the sheriff to treat him like a narcotics dog expected to sniff out the murderer <>
tim and sylvie are allowed to return to their house disturbing a crime scene of an investigation in progress <>
most ridiculous of all is tims special talent and not so much because its impossible to believe his taperecorder memory <>
rather it is the mimicked voices dubbed over tims lips which cross the line into silliness and every time they are used they just get sillier <>
{-2} of course a fundamental problem with silent fall is that its a mystery where everyone seems too stupid to figure out the obvious <>
ultimately there are only three suspects in silent fall and it tips its hand far too soon <>
what pass for attempts at diverting attention from the only real suspect fail miserably and silent fall is left to fall back on the developing relationship between jake and tim for any drama <>
while there are moments in that relationship which work quite well they lead to the films single most infuriating scene a miracle cure for tim at a crucial moment <>
for a film that wants to appear serious in its treatment of a perplexing medical condition it traffics in solutions which are far too pat and acts as a slap in the face to everyone who has ever had to live with autistic individuals by suggesting that all it takes to bring them out of it is just a little more love <>
and maybe the violent death of one or two family members <>

[2955/8]
{2} its hard to imagine a more unlikely subject for a film biography than edward d wood jr <>
when i think of biopics i think gandhi my left foot malcolm xepic tales of great and inspirational figures <>
the director of plan from outer space does not seem to be cut from quite the same cloth <>
the great surprise of ed wood is that in his own unique and twisted way director tim burton has turned one of the worst filmmakers of all time into one of those inspirational figures <>
rather than holding wood up to ridicule burton makes his life an example of artistic integrity an extremely entertaining look at an auteur unlike any other <>
{0} johnny depp stars as ed wood who is a playwright studio hand and wouldbe filmmaker when our story begins <>
ed sees his chance for a big break in a planned screen biography of transsexual christine jorgensen which ed thinks hes perfect for because of his own closet fetish for womens clothing <>
he is also able to deliver a big star for the production bela lugosi martin landau now nearly destitute and addicted to morphine <>
with lugosi and girlfriend dolores fuller sarah jessica parker ed makes glen or glenda a phenomenally incompetent melodrama <>
but ed is undaunted by the ridicule of others and forges ahead to make more films as well as forging a friendship with the ailing lugosi <>
eventually comes ed woods magnum opus the infamous plan from outer space <>
{0} burton based his vision for ed wood on one question what if someone had all the drive of orson welles but none of the talent <>
that question and its answer are what make edward d wood jrs story a comedy rather than a tragedy <>
johnny depp plays ed wood with a kind of childlike awe in the mere fact that he is able to make films and his mantra of perfect after every clumsy take becomes not simply a paradigm for selfdelusion but a reminder that sometimes process is as important to art as product <>
in one delightful scene ed runs into orson welles a dubbed vincent donofrio in a hollywood bar <>
there they exchange stories about funding problems with their latest projects plan and the recently restored don quixote respectively <>
the sincerity with which wood speaks to welles as an equal and his determination to stay true to his vision make him anything but pathetic <>
he becomes a strangely heroic maverick doing it his way even if it means doing it the wrong way <>
{0} yet burton manages to tell another story in ed wood that of the curious friendship between ed and bela lugosi <>
it is truly an example of mutual needwood needs lugosi to lend his movies credibility lugosi needs wood to give him work any workbut its also something even more touching <>
as played with eerie brilliance by martin landau lugosi is bitter broke and depressive when wood finds him in the late s and completely without respect <>
it is respect which is the greatest gift ed gives him and laundaus portrayal of his slow return to humanity is one of the finest pieces of acting this year <>
{2} it is ed woods niftiest accomplishment that it links these two stories so effortlessly <>
ed woods uniquely wonderful naivete comes from the fact that he never fully grasps that hollywood was a business first <>
he is unable to understand how lugosi could be unable to find work because to ed his talent is all that should matter <>
even through fundraising parties and creative recruiting of backers for his films its not about the money to edward d wood jr <>
its about art <>
{2} ed wood is occasionally quite slowmoving and loses much of its steam in its final twenty minutes <>
the making of plan seems to deserve more than a montage and eds relationship with wifetobe kathy patricia arquette is given only a cursory treatment <>
but the affection in burtons telling of this tale is infectious and makes one wish more talented contemporary filmmakers were as relentlessly individual <>

{-1} there are moments in this job when one is faced with separating the sobaditsentertaining from the justplainawful <>
at those times i wish i could become joe bob briggs and make the recommendation to check it out based simply on explosions naked breasts and cuban gangsterfu <>
but the specialist doesnt deserve such consideration <>
ponderous pretentious and acted with astounding indifference the specialist is a big fat bore with a couple of nice explosions <>
its too somber to work as camp and too tedious to work as anything else <>
{0} sylvester stallone stars as ray quick a former cia demolitions expert now haunted by his past and hiring out his skills with explosives freelance <>
he is contacted by may munro sharon stone a woman obsessed with the murder of her parents at the hands of three thugs led by tomas eric roberts the son of a miami drug lord rod steiger <>
ray is unsure whether he wants to take the job until he becomes a bit too personally interested in mays attempts to get closer to tomas <>
he also discovers that the drug lords head of security is ned trent james woods rays former cia partner <>
trent carries a tenyear grudge for rays part in having him thrown out of the agency and plans to use mays vendetta to exact a little vengeance of his own <>
{-2} much as one might expect the specialist is being hyped on the pairing of boxoffice heavyweights stallone and stone <>
unfortunately both of them spend most of the film looking as though theyve just done a nyquil highball <>
stone swaggers through discos in slow motion wanders through her inexplicably massive house in slow motion has sex in slow motion <>
at some point director luis llosa needed to explain to stone that haunted and bored are entirely different emotions <>
stallone is even more comatose conveying rays deep reservoir of anguish and guilt through drooping eyelids and jaw muscle isometrics as well as speaking in what can only be described as an impersonation of henry kissinger with a head cold <>
perhaps that was one of the reasons behind a scene in which stallone dispatches a group of young hoods on a bus which was added after test screenings they needed at least some evidence that he had a pulse <>
{-1} the rest of the cast is nearly as bad <>
james woods tries to cut loose as the demented trent but he never makes for a particularly threatening villain <>
hes better when humiliating a bomb squad commander or making offhanded insults about a loud shirt <>
eric roberts typecast for most of his career as a loutmouthed sleazeball playswell a slightly more sedate sleazeball delivering lines like what i want i take straight out of the introduction to basic machismo handbook <>
and rod steiger who was given to overacting even in his academy awardwinning heyday is appalling as the cuban godfather doing an accent which rivals kevin costners robin hood as the worst in recent memory <>
{-2} there are a couple of moments in the specialist which are worth unintentional giggles <>
one is the illadvised scene in which stallone and stone stand together in a hotel room undressing each other while stone stares down at the top of the stallones head <>
another is trying to understand how stones may who looks about ten years older than roberts tomas was supposed to be a young girl when an adult roberts helped kill mays parents <>
but the specialist is simply braindead from top to bottom there are almost too many examples of stupidity to single one out but my personal favorite involves may faking her own death by tossing her wallet in with a yearold corpse <>
apparently they dont have photos on id in florida <>
{1} i have to hand the pyrotechnics team credit for blowing up a hotel suite its a fairly impressive piece of work <>
but thats when i should have left <>
come to think of it i wish thats where id come in too <>

{2} every once in a while a film sneaks up on me and takes me completely by surprise <>
i dont necessarily mean in terms of quality rather im referring to the mere knowledge of its existence <>
usually i know what films are on the way a year in advance but two weeks ago i had never heard of princess caraboo <>
it has slipped rather quietly into limited release and appears destined to slip out just as quietly <>
thats a shame because princess caraboo is a delightful fable romantic gentle and very appealing <>
whats more its surprisingly insightful and provides a sharpwitted lesson in english social history <>
{0} princess caraboo is based on an actual event in early th century england involving a young woman phoebe cates who is found wandering the countryside <>
apparently unable to speak any english she is taken in by goodhearted gentlewoman mrs worrall wendy hughes <>
her banker husband jim broadbent is nonetoopleased about this strange houseguest until the worralls begin to believe that the woman may be royalty from an east indian island the princess caraboo <>
this development inspires plans for a lucrative trading venture for mr worrall and an introduction into elite social circles for mrs worrall <>
however local journalist john gutch stephen rea is not convinced that the woman is what she seems to be and sets out to find out the truth about princess caraboo <>
{1} as a social satire and comedy of manners princess caraboo is a winner <>
it takes place in an era when it was common practice in england to jail vagrants and hang beggars and that practice comes in for an obvious hazing <>
but it is handled most effectively through the character of mr worrall a drunken womanizer whose bank is in deep trouble thanks to his corruption and ineptitude <>
he is worse than one of the idle rich he is one of the actively odious gentry so eager to distance themselves from the lower class they think nothing of simply eliminating them and since the house and money are all from mrs <>
worrall he is a bit too close to them for comfort <>
while hypocrisy is an easy target for ridicule director and cowriter michael austin keeps the treatment too lighthearted to be heavyhanded <>
he also takes a unique stab at the trendiness of the upper classes as the princess becomes a sensation at court <>
in one of the films best sequences princess caraboo is the guest of honor at a party hosted by the prince regent a wonderfully foppish turn by comic john sessions and the lords and ladies end up following her around in a thoroughly silly native dance <>
it is then that princess caraboo shows how easily people are swept up in sensations an idea that takes on a timeless quality and makes the film an interesting companion piece to the current quiz show <>
{1} social commentary aside princess caraboo is simply an eminently enjoyable entertainment <>
the performers are mostly delightful particularly phoebe cates who is radiant in a part that requires a gift for pantomime <>
her supporting players are also appealing wendy hughes as the patient and kindly mrs worrall kevin kline as frixos the worralls suspicious and superior greek butler stephen rea as the worldweary but ultimately romantic gutch <>
only john lithgow is a disappointment turning in a limp performance as a scholar who attempts to verify the princesss identity <>
the story twists and turns just enough so that the question of whether or not the princess is really a princess is always in some doubt without becoming gimmicky <>
it is unfortunate that the growing attraction between gutch and princess caraboo isnt given more time to develop because the potential seemed to be there <>
when it finally does blossom it seems too quick to be plausible <>
{1} princess caraboo is patient enough in establishing its sense of time and place that it might seem a bit slow to viewers seeking a fantasy romp <>
still it has both escapist and intellectual appeal and is well worth seeking out <>
it is the kind of film that makes my job its most rewardinga hidden gem <>

{-2} director richard rush made his last film in a sly thriller called the stunt man which was one of the years critical favorites <>
he waited nearly fifteen years before making his next film color of night <>
and it looks like he may have to wait another fifteen years before anyone lets him direct again <>
color of night is just awful in every conceivable way lurching between tedium and wretched excess for an excruciating two hours and giving bruce willis his second consecutive appearance in a firstdegree bomb following north <>
{0} willis plays bill capa a new york psychologist who is traumatized when one of his patients commits suicide during a session <>
he decides to take a vacation in los angeles and visits old college buddy bob moore scott bakula himself a successful therapist <>
when moore is murdered evidence suggests someone in his monday night therapy group which capa takes over <>
soon however it appears that capa may also be the target of intended foul play <>
he is also the target of attentions from a young woman named rose jane march who seems to have a number of secrets <>
{-2} if it were not for my personal code of ethics i would reveal every plot twist in color of night since they are probably the only thing which will keep anyone watching until the bitter end <>
on the other hand im not even sure its necessary <>
color of night is so sledgehammersubtle that it would surprise me if anyone couldnt figure out the identity of the killer in the first scene in which the individual appears <>
the attempts to turn the other characters into suspects are so inept that i began to suspect that screenwriters matthew chapman and billy ray were like those deeply troubled criminals who want everyone to know exactly who did it <>
sadly its just one of the many ways they treat the audience like its made up of morons <>
in one sequence the killer uses a car to push another car off the top level of a parking garage endowed with a supernatural foreknowledge of exactly where willis is going to be walking below <>
then there are more basic matters of stupidity such as the condition from which the film takes its title willis inability to see red after the death of his patient <>
it has absolutely no bearing on the story is sloppily presented through occasional perspective shots and is just another example of the offensively simplistic psychology employed by the screenwriters <>
{-2} the main question is whether the true criminals are the writers or the actors <>
with so much scenery chewing going on they must have been able to save a fortune on catering <>
but who was the most abysmal <>
ruben blades as the loose cannon detective who appears to be in dire need of therapy himself <>
lesley ann warren as the kleptomaniacsexaholic refugee from a tennessee williams play <>
brad dourif bestunknown as the voice of chucky in the childs play films as the obsessivecompulsive lawyer doing his impression of dustin hoffman in rain man yeah definitely books definitely <>
color of night may have set back the cause of group therapy years with this collection of twitchy banshees <>
and watching over them all is the eversmirking willis who even when he is supposed to be radiating understanding looks like hes about to put on a pair of shades and break into the seagrams wine cooler jingle <>
the whole bunch should have their sag privileges suspended <>
{-2} color of night was the subject of a muchpublicized battle with the mpaa over explicit sex scenes which threatened to earn it an nc rating but dont be duped <>
color of night is about as sexy as a lump of cold mashed potatoes and less aesthetically pleasing <>
its also extremely violent particularly in the last fifteen minutes which includes some intensely unpleasant business with a nail gun <>
in richard rush clearly knew how to make a good movie <>
i guess directing isnt exactly like riding a bike <>
or in this case like driving a garbage truck <>

[2771/8]
{1} pyrotechnicians have had quite a showcase summer at the movies <>
it seems as though something has been blowing up around every cornera freight jet in speed the seven mile bridge in true lies half of boston in blown away <>
there are also explosions in clear and present danger the latest adaptation of tom clancys bestselling novels but dont let them fool you into thinking thats all there is to it <>
clear and present danger is the summers sharpest thriller less breakneck than speed but just as consistently tense and is a quantum improvement over the disappointing patriot games <>
{0} harrison ford takes his second turn as jack ryan an upright cia man who finds himself in the middle of a huge government conspiracy <>
when an old friend of the president donald moffatt is murdered over doubledealings with a columbian drug cartel the chief executive makes it clear that a military response is in order <>
cia director of operations robert ritter henry czerny hires ex company man clark willem dafoe to lead commando missions to shut down the drug lords prompting a counterresponse from one of drug lord escobedo miguel sandoval and his chief lietenant cortez joaquim de almeida <>
when ryan takes over for his ailing boss james earl jones he begins to realize that something is rotten in the us government and sets out both to find the paper trail that leads to the top and to save the american soldiers stranded by another executive order <>
{2} i wasnt terribly optimistic about clear and present danger after director phillip noyces sluggish work on patriot games and the appalling sliver but his work here positively crackles <>
he turns a showdown in a single barricaded street into a chase as exciting as of cinematic car chases covering miles of ground a chaotic and dynamic set piece <>
the level of tension is nearly perfect in scenes that ordinarily would be humdrum like a walk through an airport where ryan is being shadowed by clark but were often unsure where clark is <>
and in one of dangers snappiest sequences ryan races to download evidence from ritters computer files before they are deleted <>
there are a few moments where noyce goes overboard like an inexplicable slowmotion shot of escobedo in a batting cage and a sequence at a funeral that plays far too much like the baptism sequence from the godfather <>
these are minor quibbles however in a film that comes off as one of the best espionage thrillers in a decade <>
{-1} it might have been even better if harrison ford had managed to break out of his recent habit of playing every part in a slight daze <>
to his credit he seems to have rediscovered jack ryan the desk jockey looking comically uncomfortable traipsing through the jungle and providing a very reluctant heroism <>
but ever since presumed innocent in ford has been doing variations on his overwhelmed everyman and as a result is beginning to look even older than his years <>
clear and present danger asks very little from its cast as a whole though so fords lowerthanlowkey ryan doesnt seriously detract from the proceedings <>
only james earl jones spending most of his scenes in a hospital gown truly energizes his role though willem dafoe does outcharisma ford in the supporting role of clark <>
{1} but lets be real here no one expected james bond to be multifaceted and tormented <>
clear and present danger is thoroughly plotdriven from minute one and its oddball screenwriting team of john red dawn milius and steven schindlers list zaillian along with donald stewart do an impressive job with a challenging adaptation <>
if political moralizing isnt your cup of tea be forewarned clear and present danger has more than its share <>
it also has as much action as the bloated true lies and nearly as many honest laughs <>
what the fugitive was to clear and present danger is to a pulsepounding late summer surprise with smarts <>

[2769/8]
{0} issues of quality aside this is the best advice i can give to anyone considering seeing ang lees eat drink man woman do not see it on an empty stomach <>
like s like water for chocolate eat drink man woman is a cinematic dream for those with a weakness for scrupulously prepared cuisines and a nightmare for dieters <>
also like that earlier film it is about much more than recipes <>
eat drink man woman like lees oscarnominated film the wedding banquet is a story of generational conflict a witty and emotionally involving tale in which food plays a pivotal role in observations on a changing chinese culture <>
{0} eat drink man woman is the story of the chus a family living in modern taipei <>
old chu sihung lung is a widowed master chef sharing his home with three grown daughters <>
jiajen kueimei yang is a repressed schoolteacher who is a christian convert jiachien chienlien wu is an executive for a taiwanese airline jianing yuwen wang is a student who works in a fast food restaurant <>
all three humor their fathers elaborate sunday dinners but each has desires conflicting with old chus world <>
eventually all of them find themselves entangled in complicated romances including old chu himself who is pursued by a garrulous old family friend ahleh gua <>
the playing out of these relationships leads to a confrontation with family tensions <>
{2} the title of eat drink man woman comes from a chinese proverb dealing with the basic necessities for continuing life but it is used ironically by old chu to note how even the simplest things have become complicated <>
from the opening shots of a swarm of scooters crossing a busy intersection juxtaposed with chus traditional cooking eat drink man woman becomes an examination of a modern world clashing with an ancient culture <>
each of chess daughters represents a merging of cultures jiajens religion brings christianity into the mix jiachiens airline is in the process of acquiring routes into new countries jianings job at a wendys where the customers cant always tell what theyre eating mocks chus life work <>
chu copes by maintaining a silent distance yet as he notes other cultures seeping into his own he begins to lose the one thing that allows him to preserve a pure culture the ability to taste his food <>
we communicate through food notes jiachien at one dinner and with a breakdown in the ability of the traditional cuisine to bridge the generations comes a total failure of communication <>
its rich thematic ground and ang lee does a fantastic job of finding influences particularly american influences everywhere particularly a humorously misnamed stuffed purple dinosaur called harvey <>
{1} eat drink man woman also explores romantic relationships in this context of generational change and there it is less consistently successful <>
each of the four main characters is given a subplot and like old chus dinners the film begins to seem like there is a bit too much to consume in one sitting <>
the youngest daughters story is particularly weak and the film might have been more effective if her character had been dropped entirely <>
otherwise solid acting makes for some affecting stories <>
sihung lung so good as the father in the wedding banquet is again taciturn without being onenote and provides a solid anchor for the film <>
the best story belongs to kueimei yangs jiajen and she does a magnificent job of playing all of jiajens buried emotions at just the right level <>
also noteworthy are two delightful supporting performances ahleh gua lungs wife in wedding banquet as the nonstop mrs liang and jui wang as old wen chus best friend and fellow chef <>
{1} i was not a huge fan of the wedding banquet i felt it was inconsistently paced and that its weak lead performances hindered its emotional pull <>
here however ang lee has put all the pieces together <>
though it runs a bit long eat drink man woman is a warm and keenly observed character piece filled with mostly exceptional performances <>
see it as it makes its way to your town after a large meal naturally <>

[2750/2]
{-2} in director rob reiner brought to the screen a satirical fantasy that was thought to be unfilmable william goldmans the princess bride <>
though uneven it basically worked thanks to a genuine sense of whimsy and goldmans own clever adaptation <>
the relative success of the princess bride would seem to suggest that if anyone could make a movie out of alan zweibels goofy fable north it would be reiner wrong <>
instead he has turned out a smug tedious and wrongheaded mess which wraps the moral of the wizard of oz in a thoroughly unappealing package <>
{0} north is the name of a multitalented elevenyearold elijah wood who feels that he is being ignored by his selfinvolved parents jason alexander julia louisdreyfuss <>
he decides that he deserves better and declares himself a free agent offering himself to the most attractive pair of parents <>
a judge grants norths request under the condition that he make his final choice in two months or face being sent to an orphanage <>
north then sets off on a globespanning quest for the perfect parents which inspires a kids rights movement masterminded by norths devious classmate winchell mathew mccurley and an ambulancechasing lawyer jon lovitz <>
along the way north receives advice from a ubiquitous man bruce willis who acts as his guardian angel <>
{-1} for a few moments at the very beginning north looks like it might be on the right track <>
there is a clever little sequence showing north as a brilliant student a top athlete and a budding star of the musical theater pitched at just the right level of lowkey surreality a bit later a series of parents chastise their children with all the things that north wouldnt do <>
but very early on north takes a precipitous dive into nearunwatchability <>
norths encounters with his prospective parents including dan aykroyd and reba mcintire as howdee texans and kathy bates and graham greene as eskimos are repetitious and annoying all variations on the same theme <>
in order for the fairytale onedimensionality of these parents to work they all need to represent something unique not interchangeable levels of stupidity <>
most surprising reiner paces everything at a crawl including a production number in the texas sequence which should have pumped some life in the proceedings <>
instead its just another part of an minute film which feels minutes too long <>
{-2} there is yet another massive misstep with an emphasis on the subplot involving mathew mccurley as the miniature machiavelli and jon lovitz as his attorneytoady <>
mccurley is allowed to chew the scenery lisping ruthlessbeyondhisyears dialogue and mincing about in suspenders and slicked back hair as sure a sign of cinematic evil as a tattoo <>
cringing is lovitzs forte and he gets to do a lot of it playing to all of his worst instincts <>
the youth revolt might have worked with a lighter touch but reiner makes it too nasty darkened further by a murder plot which engenders a pointless chase <>
{-1} where did so much talent go so dreadfully wrong <>
reiner has been boxoffice gold coscreenwriters zweibel an original saturday night live scribe and andrew scheinman this summers pleasant fantasy little big league have some great product under their belts <>
elijah wood a talented young actor is a rather obnoxious north taking the books more measured nineyearold protagonist and turning him into an adolescent packing a serious attitude <>
reiner probably called in every favor he had to pepper north with cameos but they serve only to show that its possible for an entire supporting cast to be as bored making a film as the audience is watching it <>
{-1} perhaps the biggest mystery of north is for what audience it was intended <>
its too slow and full of dopey injokes to keep kids interested and too simplistic for adults <>
rob reiner had better check his compass he got dreadfully lost trying to find north <>

[2719/8]
{1} it may be my imagination but the last two years seem to have been a particularly good time to be a young actor <>
films focusing on younger characters have been everywhere from free willy to searching for bobby fischer to king of the hill to this boys life <>
whether its representative of some societal yearning for a return to innocence a rare influx of young talent or some happy confluence of the two comingofage dramas have become nearly as ubiquitous as hugh grant <>
none of which makes a good one any less desirable and the slingshot is a good one indeed a sharply written swedish import with a singular perspective and exceptional performances <>
{0} based on an autobiographical novel by roland schutt the slingshot tells the story of tenyearold roland jasper salen and his trials and tribulations living in s sweden <>
he is a boy with two strikes against him the child of a dogmatically socialist father stellan skarsgaard and a jewish mother basia frydman <>
this lineage makes him the target of schoolyard bullies sadistic schoolmasters and government officials who tend to use him as a scapegoat <>
even with his family he is not safe as his older brother niclas olund an aspiring boxer uses him as a punching bag <>
but in spite of his many obstacles roland navigates through his difficult world with determination and an inventive spirit <>
{0} as with the other recent films i mentioned the slingshot rests squarely on the small shoulders of its young star and jasper salen is up to the task <>
with a round open face reminiscent of a christmas storys peter billingsley salen manages to convey both innocence and toughness in the delicate balancing act required by ake sandgrens adaptation <>
while many things happen to roland he is never merely a receptacle <>
he exhibits a cockiness born of necessity and a gift for utilizing the tools at his disposal to get ahead <>
when another boy offers roland a used bike he hasnt the money for roland offers to repair and paint some other bikes to repay his debt <>
after a fight with his brother results in roland owing his father money as well he tries to earn it by selling balloons made out of the condoms his mother distributes illegally <>
roland is always thinking and it is this intelligence that comes through in salens performance <>
he is complemented by a wonderful supporting cast particularly stellan skarsgaard as rolands father a driven man who compensates for his crippling sciatica by pushing himself and his family to their limits <>
{1} although the slingshot is as one might expect primarily episodic it is still rich enough thematically that it never feels like merely a loose collection of scenes <>
foremost among these themes is the clash of capitalism and socialism personified by roland himself <>
while his father lectures to him about the revolution roland fashions many creations with condoms and imagines himself credited as the inventor of the underwater sock and the condom slingshot <>
when roland shows a cat his newly refurbished bike and says to it thats mine it is as succinct a statement of rebellion as one might imagine <>
there is also a nicely played scene in which rolands father who is acting as a body double for a portrait of the king momentarily forgets his politics when he puts on a pair of expensive shoes <>
this is not to say that the slingshot acts as little more than a onesided political tract sandgren is equally critical of the restrictive government policies which turn the schutts into criminals for advocating birth control <>
however it is rolands internal struggle with his heritage that makes his external struggles even more potent <>
{1} the slingshots key failing may be that it tries to do too much and some of the scenes begin to seem repetitive <>
the obligatory moment of sexual awakening seems just thatobligatoryand ends with a scene surprisingly lacking in emotional punch <>
a late series of events which involves rolands implication in a crime bogs down seriously and removes him from the relationships which drive his story <>
those relationships particularly rolands complex interaction with his father are what make the slingshot memorable <>
thanks to jasper salens splendid work the slingshot takes its place as a worthy addition to the list of fine comingofage films <>

[2680/8]
{2} film reviewers myself included often obsess over originality <>
everything is derivative we lament everything is recycled <>
then periodically i am reminded that given the choice between an original film and a good one i would much prefer the latter <>
fear of a black hat has been referred to as this is spinal rap on more than one occasion and it is true that there is more than a passing similarity between the two <>
all right there is a remarkable similarity <>
but ultimately only one thing really matters fear of a black hat is very very funny probably the funniest film of the year so far <>
{0} fear of a black hat is set up as a documentary being made by a doctoral student kasi lemmons as her sociology thesis project <>
her subject is ontherise rap gangsta rap group nwh niggaz with hats whose members are rappers ice cold rusty cundieff and tasty taste larry b scott and dj tone def mark christopher lawrence <>
the documentary chronicles clashes between nwh and their record company over their controversial songs and videos including their breakout hit guerrillas in the midst <>
but inevitably egos and women conspire to form a rift between the members and each explores new avenues as a solo artist <>
can nwh patch up their differences and stage a big comeback <>
{1} in terms of plot structure it often seems that writer directorstar rusty cundieff decided simply to colorize spinal tap <>
it is not simply the framing device which is borrowed but a multitude of specific details gigs with somewhat insulting billing on the marquis internal squabbles triggered by a domineering girlfriend taps series of illfated drummers replaced by nwhs series of illfated managers <>
yet with all these borrowed elements there are a couple of other things cundieff might have been wellserved to duplicate <>
one is keeping the framing structure consistent <>
frequently the camera work breaks out of the verite style for shots a singlecamera documentary really couldnt be filming <>
the other is keeping the performances as deadpan as possible <>
kasi lemmons in particular dreadfully overplays her part and howie gold is a cliche as manager <>
if fear of a black hat tends to stumble its when it veers into campiness <>
{1} even then there are some huge laughs to be had in black hat <>
while some of the objects of satire are unnecessarily heavyhanded white rapper vanilla sherbet slammer formerly known as mc slammer others are dead on <>
tone defs solo project is a hilarious bit modeled after pm dawn and the rivalry between nwh and other rappers over who has the longest rap sheet sets up a great confrontation at a grade school presentation <>
but cundieff is perhaps most adept at skewering raps selfimportant politics through ice colds wonderfully improbable explanations of how songs such as booty juice actually contain an important social message <>
even the misogyny in rap culture is nailed perfectly in a single line perhaps the films funniest be sure to stay through the credits or youll miss it <>
also worth noting are the numerous song parodies by cundieff and john bautista which range from the sublime tone defs im just a human being to the obnoxious come and pet the pussy <>
{2} there are a lot of great details in fear of a black hat my favorite being tasty tastes massive bowlingtrophyonachain necklace which makes it frustrating that cundieff often plays up the broader bits <>
an obligatory scene in which ice cold is pulled over and hassled by a rentacop is dragged out far too long and a parody of new jack city seems only to serve as a way to take a jab at black filmmakers jike spingleton is the director <>
still i laughed harder and more often at fear of a black hat than at any other movie in quite some time <>
make sure youre in the house when nwh comes to your town <>

[2602/8]
{2} i cant think of a film in the last few years set in ireland that i did not enjoy and im fairly sure its not coincidence <>
when an irish setting is involved i tend to lose all objectivity <>
its me celtic roots crying out it is <>
the verdant hills the piqued accents the mystical catholicism all grip me in a way that is difficult to explain <>
so i warn ye to take my comments regarding widows peak with a certain grain of salt even though i believe that you dont need to be a celtophile to find it a wonderfully entertaining comedymystery <>
{0} set in widows peak is the story of a unique community of kilshannon ireland so nicknamed by the locals because of its rather restrictive demographics <>
the mother of mrs doyle counihan joan plowright left a will permitting only widows to live in the houses on her land with special exceptions allowed like that for miss katherine ohare mia farrow <>
into this insular world comes mrs edwina broome natasha richardson a flamboyant englishwoman raised in america <>
although mrs broome claims to be the widow of a wealthy english soldier miss ohare is very vocal in her suspicions that mrs broome is not what she claims to be particularly when mrs broome begins romancing mrs doyle counihans son godfrey adrian dunbar <>
the feud between the two women escalates until scandalous secrets come to the fore and the town is filled with talk of murder <>
{1} widows peak was directed by john irvin whose previous projects have been primarily actionoriented raw deal hamburger hill and it may be that sensibility which makes this film more than just another pastoral romp <>
while there is plenty of lovely scenery there is also a tremendous level of energy a sassy edge uncommon to films in similar settings <>
a sequence involving miss ohare and mrs broome racing across a lake on motorboats is staged with zest and the town regatta seems genuinely alive with activity <>
the high spirits are further enhanced by the performances <>
joan plowright is wonderful as the dowager queen of widows peak even if she could play a part like this in her sleep by now <>
her matterof fact confidence that her every whim should be gospel is delightful to watch as are the subtle ways in which she demonstrates her condescension <>
natasha richardson goes appropriately overthetop as the sexy and perhaps sinister mrs broome looking precisely like the personification of a red dress at a funeral <>
adrian dunbar is also exceptional as godfrey who puts on a great show of wanting to break free of his mothers overbearing will but proves too willing to play the doting son <>
{2} of course there is also mia farrow <>
in her first postwoody outing farrow reminds us that she can indeed play something besides a female version of woody allens neurotic persona <>
her role here is a tricky one to pull off balancing several layers of suspicion and deception but she does pull it off and with surprising grace <>
she gets some positively venomous lines and seems to delight in delivering them <>
irvin has clearly made her role the showcase and in one last lingering shot seems to be saying i knew you could do it <>
{1} the mystery elements which drive the second half of the film are perhaps a bit too easy to figure out as irvin and screenwriter hugh leonard underline each of their clues with too much emphasis <>
but if they are not tremendously surprising it doesnt seem as though they were really intended to be <>
this is not a film predicated on some gaspinducing crying gamelike twist rather the plot twists are just there to allow the character development befuddling at first to fall into place <>
in fact the only time widows peak really slows down is when there is lengthy exposition particularly at a dinner party which is unfortunately handled in a slightly clumsy manner <>
but with or without the mystery widows peak would still have been funny and frisky filled with nicely detailed cultural moments but mostly just a crisp and funfilled hour and forty minutes <>

[2546/8]
{2} when i stepped into the theater to see clean slate i had yet to see any evidence that dana carvey might actually be capable of acting <>
in fact he seemed incapable of anything but the broadest schtick <>
his saturday night live characters were usually caricatures and the waynes world films and the horrible opportunity knocks simply regurgitated those characters <>
so it qualifies as one of the most unexpected surprises of the year that clean slate turns out to be an absolutely delightful comedy <>
as improbable as the concept might seem director mick jackson the bodyguard reins in carveys tendency towards excess and gives him a real character to work with and the chance to generate big laughs <>
{0} carvey plays m l pogue a smalltime private eye with a bigtime problem <>
as the result of an explosion pogue suffers from a unique form of amnesia which causes him to wake up every morning with no memory of anything which has taken place before he fell asleep <>
that proves a hindrance professionally as he is supposed to testify against criminallyconnected businessman cornell michael gambon but cant remember his testimony <>
its also problematic personally as he seems to be involved with at least two women one of whom valeria golino is supposed to be dead <>
with every passing day pogues mystery continues and deepensuntil he finds that he cant trust anyone <>
{2} clean slate is so full of unpredictable pleasures that its difficult to know where to begin <>
the greatest is probably the performance of carvey in a role analagous in many ways to bill murrays in groundhog day <>
like phil connor pogue is trapped in a cycle of repetition and confusion except that pogue is the only one who doesnt know whats going on like murray carvey gets a chance to play some low key scenes that prove he doesnt always have to be a class clown <>
he gets to play several hysterical scenes based on pogues need to improvise every encounter with his friends including james earl jones as a wheelchairbound district attorney kevin pollak as pogues jealous best friend and michael murphy as his doctor including a surprise birthday party and his eventual testimony against cornell <>
however carver is equally affecting in moments such as his reaction to discovering that he might be a father and trying desperately to remember a woman he thinks he loves <>
the nature of pogues condition inevitably limits his character development but merely watching carvey react to that situation is endlessly entertaining <>
{2} but there is virtually nothing about clean slate which isnt quirky offhanded and charming <>
screenwriter robert king has filled this film with bits that come out of left field like the sequence where pogue and his mysterious client attempt to escape cornells henchmen with well aimed rocks or a couple of unexplained moments when pogue demonstrates martial arts skills or pogues dog who suffers from a lack of depth perception <>
director jackson complements the weirdness with visual throwaways like the neck brace james earl jones character wears with a hole for his tie to come through and the bandaid carvey sports through out the film <>
clean slate is that rare comedy which simply never goes exactly where you expect it to go <>
{1} all this would be quite enough to recommend clean slate but it also provides a neatlyplotted little mystery <>
occasionally it feels as though king and jackson are trying to throw in a bit too much the character of pogues exwife is particularly unnecessary which sidetracks the films energy <>
however at the end of clean slate i was left without a single plausibility problem <>
{2} in the hours since i saw clean slate bits and pieces have popped into my head constantly prompting spontaneous laughter and it just keeps growing on me <>
it wouldnt be surprising given carveys track record and an advertising campaign which cant do it justice to see clean slate make a quick exit from theaters <>
then again there might just be one more surprise coming <>

[2531/1]
{-2} id be willing to bet that someone sold the concept for bad girls with a oneline pitch like the wild bunch in bloomers <>
such is the way in hollywood these days <>
after all westerns have been hot at the box office and making the protagonists women guarantees a smidgen of politically correct credibility in addition to cleavage <>
besides with the paucity of good roles for women talented actresses like madeleine stowe and mary stuart masterson will jump at that chance to shoot guns <>
the problem is that these prefabricated films almost never bring along a script <>
bad girls is always either hopelessly cliche or insufferably stupidand usually both <>
{0} bad girls is the story of four prostitutes in echo city colorado who wind up on the run together when one of them cody zamora stowe kills an unruly customer <>
she is saved from the hangmans noose by anita masterson eileen andie macdowell and lily drew barrymore and they head out together with detectives hot on their trail <>
their plan is to make their way to oregon where anita and her late husband had a timber claim and to finance a lumber operation with codys ample savings <>
these plans are interrupted when those savings are stolen by kid jarrett james russo a notorious bandit who has a history with cody <>
the women and the gang of thieves repeatedly cross paths until it becomes clear that this movie aint big enough for the both of em <>
{-1} bad girls is frequently so incoherent that i was forced to wonder whether director had chopped all the raw footage into two minute chunks strewn them about on the editing room floor and pieced the film together in whatever order he happened to pick them up <>
i knew i was in trouble from the outset when the rescue of cody takes place <>
screenwriters ken friedman and yolande finch couldnt be bothered with such niceties as explaining why eileen and lily might want to save cody at least anita was the one cody saved <>
there is not a second spent letting these characters interact first so that there seems to be some kind of connection between them <>
apparently its enough that theyre sisters in the worlds oldest profession <>
then we are introduced to josh dermot mulroney a taciturn cowboy whos out to avenge wild guess anyone the death of his pa <>
the thing is that this subplot is not only cliche its put together in the least economical way possible with the inclusion of kid jarretts aging father robert loggia <>
this additional character just muddles the movie further in fact i would go so far as to say that the inclusion of the entire josh subplot is unnecessary <>
but that would have left cody without a love interest and we couldnt have that now could we <>
{-1} oh but theres more pardners <>
in the last two minutes there is the suggestion that lily harbors a more intimate affection for eileen something we are completely unaware of until the music swells to a tearjerking crescendo which means nothing because we have been given no background <>
james legros makes an appearance as a simple homesteader who wins eileens heart but his is the only performance that isnt completely perfunctory <>
madeleine stowe and mary stuart masterson are two of my favorite current young actresses and both are forced to spout dialogue which puts the hack back in hackneyed <>
director jonathan kaplan apparently had no idea what to do with a western so rather than set up his own shots he tries to do his halfhearted homage to sam peckinpah with disastrous results <>
whole set pieces are ripped off from the wild bunch and kaplans use of slow motion becomes absurdly comic <>
the cinematography is quite good but a big pile of garbage is a big pile of garbage no matter what kind of filter you put over the lens <>
{-2} sometimes you can look at a film as bad as bad girls and see the germ of an interesting idea that was undeveloped or simply butchered but not here <>
there isnt the faintest attempt to make bad girls a real examination of the plight of women in the american west the women are just a gimmick unlike in the ballad of little jo <>
bad girls is lazy stupid sloppy and worst of all boring <>
they are women hear me snore <>

{-2} all right ill admit it im guilty of a bias towards writers <>
perhaps its the part of me that identifies with them or the romantic image of a guy alone in a room staring down a blank sheet of paper in a battered manual smithcorona until the paper blinks first <>
the fact is that when i feel a project has gone sour the writer is frequently the last target of my wrath and the first one to get the benefit of the doubt <>
not this time <>
i cant think of a director alive who could have done anything with cops robbersons or an actor who could have made it watchable <>
to call this script inept would be to give it more credit than it deserves <>
{0} chevy chase stars as norman robberson a suburban father of three whose family doesnt respect him at all <>
to compensate for his timidity in real life norman watches every tv cop show he can memorizes police procedures and worships their heroics from afar <>
the chance to worship up close comes when a counterfeiter robert davi moves in next door and the police decide to set up a stakeout in the robbersons home <>
the veteran in the stakeout team is jake stone jack palance a growling tough guy who immediately commands everyones respect <>
meanwhile norman gets caught up in the action and in his attempt to help out ends up jeopardizing the entire operation <>
{-2} it is exceedingly difficult to imagine what bernie somers was thinking when he started putting this mess together <>
it often seems as though he never developed the idea beyond a singlesentence pitchcops move in with a loser who idolizes cops <>
there isnt a single original situation or character to be found but that can be said of eight scripts out of ten that come out of hollywood <>
the more telling point is that somers didnt seem to have a clue where to go with this story <>
the predictable resolution would have been for milquetoast norman to discover an inner reserve of strength and end up saving the day <>
but even that simplistic an answer seems to be beyond his grasp <>
norman begins and ends the film exactly the same and there isnt even a pat answer provided for why there is anything different in the way his family would treat him <>
{-1} then there are the other characterizations which run from the stereotypical to the incomprehensible <>
jason james richter free willy as the rebellious son and fay masterson the man without a face as the teenage daughter are completely without personality and diane weist is saddled with an unpleasant shrewishness <>
robert davi who by now might as well have the word villain tattooed to his forehead bounces from nasty to clownish as the counterfeiter <>
among the creative stretches in the plot are the daughter falling for the hunky young cop david barry gray and the family ending up hostages <>
please my heart cant take any more surprises <>
{-2} the biggest losers however are probably the two names above the title <>
chase as ive already noted is stuck with a character who goes nowhere dooming him from the start <>
still it would have been nice if he hadnt walked through the film as though he were still stunned by the cancellation of his talk show <>
hes not even as endearingly incompetent as the vacation series clark griswold just deathly boring <>
jack palance doesnt fare much better but he does have an innate gruff charm that transcends the role as written however that still doesnt explain why the robbersons seem so instantly drawn to jake despite his abusiveness nor why jake eventually reciprocates <>
if all you want is the chance to see palance flare his nostrils and roll his own cigarettes rent city slickers again <>
{-2} i laughed exactly twice during cops robbersons once when chase attempts to roll his own cigarette and once during a coda which plays on palances famous onearmed pushups <>
even at bargain prices thats two bucks a laugh <>
thats a crime <>

{1} lets compare the cinematic bards of baltimore for a moment <>
in one corner we have barry levinson who painted the city in nostalgic sienna tones with diner tin men and avalon <>
in the other is john waters with polyester hairspray and now serial mom <>
if im guessing id say that the chamber of commerce might lean towards levinson <>
however when putting their latest films head to head i think my choice is obvious <>
levinsons jimmy hollywood was a slapdash attempt at social commentary serial mom is a sly bullseye hitting every target in sight with a return to the gloriously grotesque john waters of pink flamingos fameinfamy <>
{0} kathleen turner stars as beverly sutphin a suburban housewife with everything loving husband eugene sam waterston feisty son chip matthew lillard sweet daughter misty ricki lake <>
she also has a little secret she kills people <>
a lot of people <>
anyone who crosses her really from the teacher who insults her son to the boy who jilts her daughter <>
with the growing body count beverly increasingly becomes the object of suspicion especially when eugene finds correspondence between beverly and ted bundy <>
eventually beverly is brought to trial a trial which becomes a huge media event and a potential tv movie starring suzanne somers herself <>
{1} waters manages to comment on so many different aspects of contemporary society that its hard to believe he intended them all <>
at the top of his hit list is our fascination with tabloid sensationalism and the cult of personality which develops around antisocial behavior <>
beverly reads helter skelter and collects clippings of mass murder stories chip is delighted by the fame moms trial brings <>
even the neighborhood busybodies who are quickest to condemn beverly get together to watch talk shows about girlfriends of serial killers <>
without handwringing waters points out our complicity in such crimes through our fascination with them <>
but he doesnt stop there <>
also under his scrutiny are the latent vigilantism borne of feelings of powerlessness and the foibles of both conservatives beverlys rigid sense of propriety and liberals one witness against beverly is discredited because she doesnt recycle <>
his one stumble into heavyhandedness comes when chips girlfriend reacts to the difference between real blood and movie blood but basically waters keeps the tone light with his cartoonish style <>
this is twin peaks as performed by the three stooges <>
{2} social commentary aside serial mom is just plain funny <>
waters goes for the grossout from the getgo as his name in the credits appears under a crushed fly this leads to beverly skewering her daughters wouldbe beau inadvertently removing some viscera and to a messy sneeze which leads to anarchy in a church <>
there is a gleeful scene as beverly clubs a woman to death with a leg of lamb while singing along to tomorrow from annie and another at a concert where beverly is led away in cuffs to a chant of serial mom serial mom <>
the highlight however is definitely the trial where beverly defends herself in some very creative ways while her family hawks serial mom tshirts outside the courthouse <>
the opening is a bit slow but serial mom finishes with high energy <>
{2} waters sprinkles serial mom liberally with kitschy cameos like somers patricia hearst as a juror who becomes the object of beverlys ire and riot girl band l but it is kathleen turners performance as beverly which sparkles <>
turner has suffered through so many bad films in recent years that it is a pleasure to see her with something she can sink her teeth into <>
her smiling amalgam of donna reed and hannibal lecter is frequently campy but always appealing creating another level of identification which implicates the audience <>
its true that the characters in serial mom are onedimensional but thats almost appropriate given the films framework as a truecrime reenactment of the real events <>
serial mom is fun with an edge and it killed me <>

[2501/8]
{1} it was considered something of an upset when the academy award for foreign language film went to spains belle epoque but in retrospect it really shouldnt have been <>
the category has recently favored safe small entertainments over big political epics as evidenced by the victory for mediterraneo <>
belle epoque bears more than a passing resemblance to that former winner its a sunny sensual comedy with all the makings of a crossover success <>
although it features no real story to speak of and some clownish characters its frisky tone and clever direction by fernando trueba make it a worthwhile experience <>
{0} belle epoque takes place in spain where a republican revolution has challenged the monarchy and the catholic church <>
fernando jorge sanz a member of the kings army with republican sentiments has deserted into the spanish country side <>
he meets manolo fernando fernan gomez a freethinking artist and political simpatico who offers to take fernando in for the night <>
however fernandos arrival coincides with a visit from manolos four daughters serious widow clara miriam diazaroca mannish violeta ariadna gil lusty rocio maribel verdu and innocent luz penelope cruz <>
fernando ends up staying just a bit longer than planned switching affections between the sisters as fast as he changes beds while the political drama plays out in the background <>
{2} comedy is probably the hardest cinematic genre to translate from foreign language films so it is high praise indeed to note that belle epoque had the audience where i saw the film laughing hard and often <>
the subtitling is superb losing only minor idioms in the translation <>
those more familiar with spanish history and culture might be quicker to figure out what a carlist is or the humor behind the parish priests affinity for philosopher miguel de unamuno but far more of the fun in belle epoque transcends particulars of culture <>
there are delightful moments of physical comedy most notably violetas genderbending seduction of fernando while both are in costume at a carnival <>
another highlight is the arrival of manolos opera singer wife and her jealous manager accompanied by a window serenade <>
the humor is almost entirely accessible and its very winning <>
{1} much of belle epoques earthy charm comes from the slightly anachronistic ifitfeelsgooddoit attitude of many of the principal characters <>
this is not as one might expect some leering variation on the old traveling salesmanfarmers daughters story manolos response to fernandos revelation of his tryst with violeta is delightfully unexpected <>
director trueba uses the backdrop of the republican revolution to highlight a shift away from the rigidly catholic spain to a more liberal era a transition emphasized in wonderful scenes involving rocios uptight fiance juanito and his domineering mother <>
juanito is so deeply rooted in catholicism that when he rebels against his mother he goes to the local church believing there is some ceremony involved in renouncing the faith <>
{-1} however belle epoque makes no pretense to being about anything and it is in that respect that the film commits its few errors <>
there is really no plot just a series of amusing encounters which dont serve to develop any of the characters <>
the characterizations are somewhat weak particularly that of fernando whose seminarian background professed agnosticism and unabashed romanticism are never successfully linked <>
clara luz and rocio are too sketchy and juanito is simply a buffoon <>
there are two strong performances from ariadna gil as violeta and fernando fernan gomez as manolo and it is no coincidence that they are also the most fully developed characters <>
still belle epoque does what trueba intends for it to do which is to entertain and amuse <>
it may not have been my choice for an oscar but there could have been far worse choices <>

[2495/4]
{-1} if there has been one theme one can identify running through the work of director barry levinson it is the search for the american dream <>
he brought us the ambitious salesmen of tin men the optimistic immigrants of avalon and the visionary bugsy all darklytinged stories of guys trying to make their mark and make it big <>
jimmy hollywood is another such story but it is lacking something previous levinson projects had namely a firm grasp on what the protagonsists dreams were <>
there are interesting ideas in the script and some of the dry humor characteristic of levinsons dialogue but its never all that compelling because the character of jimmy alto is too schizophrenic and with him the tone of the whole film <>
{0} jimmy hollywood is the nickname of jimmy alto joe pesci a struggling actor who has gone so far as to buy an advertisement for himself on a bus stop bench <>
he also adores the hollywood of the glamorous s and s and spends afternoons memorizing the stars on the walk of fame with addled friend william christian slater <>
that hollywood is strongly at odds with the reality jimmy sees around him however and when a couple of crimes hit close to home he decides to do something about it <>
along with william jimmy catches a thief and turns him in with a note identifying the captors as the sos <>
when the public begins expressing appreciation for the vigilantes jimmy begins to play the role for all its worth to the dismay of longsuffering girlfriend lorena victoria abril <>
{-1} at various times levinson appears to be trying to tell two different stories through jimmy <>
one is about the thankless life of being a struggling actor including the cattle calls waiting tables and shameless selfpromotion necessary to make it <>
jimmy never doubts for a minute that his big break is just around the corner and when his vigilante persona jericho becomes a media sensation he is unwilling to give up what he considers the role of a lifetime <>
at the same time levinson paints a picture of a onetime tinseltown which has disintegrated into a city of drug deals homelessness and atm muggings <>
what happens is that it is never clear what motivates jimmy <>
one moment it appears that he is a starryeyed altruist who wants only to return hollywood to its former glory the next he is simply a publicityhungry wouldbe actor using crime to make a name for himself <>
the jimmy who wants to strike fear into the hearts of criminals doesnt gel with the jimmy who reveals himself for a big sendoff <>
it is typical of levinson to make his heroes motives less than completely pure but in this instance theyre simply muddled <>
it is difficult to care all that much about jimmy and its difficult to figure out whether levinson wants us to focus on his characters or the setting <>
{-1} it is also a simple truth that jimmy hollywood was a hard film for me to like <>
while it has its humorous moments its too grim to be a purely entertaining comedy and it doesnt explore its dark themes deeply enough to be an insightful drama <>
its two principal characters are frequently more pathetic than they are sympathetic the pacing is extremely deliberate and the shifts in tone had me shifting in my seat a lot <>
when i did find interesting elements it was more a case of depatched admiration than enjoyment <>
{0} among the objects of admiration were two performances neither of them joe pescis <>
pesci needs to step back from motormouthed new yorkers because they are all beginning to look the same <>
his costars however are quite good <>
victoria abril livens up the token girlfriend role with some strong scenes particularly a hillside farewell <>
the big surprise is a funny and affecting christian slater whose forgetful william does the lowkey performance in untamed heart one better <>
slater is developing into a complete actor and his performance here is extremely interesting <>
yet perhaps interesting is the faint praise with which i ultimately damn jimmy hollywood <>
i found a number of things in the film interesting <>
i just found none of them truly engaging <>

[2467/8]
{2} im no marketing whiz but it would appear that someone made a serious error in the advertising campaign for the new australian import sirens <>
the posters prominently feature the bare back of costarsupermodel elle macpherson accompanied by the line be seduced <>
one might be inclined to believe that the target audience is men and that sirens is simply some softcore porn throwaway <>
in fact sirens has more in common with enchanted april than it does with emmanuelle <>
writerdirector john duigan creator of the wonderful comingofage films the year my voice broke and flirting has fashioned another tale of sexual awakening this time focusing on an adult and its a delightfully acted and beautifully filmed comedydrama <>
{0} sirens is a fictional story based on the truelife s artist norman lindsay sam neill a freethinking australian whose nude studies particularly the crucified venus created a stir in conservative british circles <>
when the anglican church becomes concerned about the blasphemous paintings inclusion in an international exhibition of lindsays work it sends clergyman anthony campion hugh grant and his wife estella tara fitzgerald to convince lindsay to withdraw it voluntarily <>
the very proper british couple is invited to stay at lindsays wild and lush compound where they meet his three principal models lusty sheela elle macpherson socialist prue kate fischer and innocent giddy portia de rossi <>
while anthony works to persuade lindsay estella is left to discover the untamed world of the australian blue mountains <>
gradually a change comes over her as the influence of the uninhibited models opens estellas eyes to desires she didnt know she had <>
{2} sirens skillfully interweaves two themes without seeming overstuffed <>
the principal story that of estellas response to the liberated and liberating world of the lindsay estate focuses on how that world interacts with the restrictive female sexual mores of the time <>
tara fitzgerald does an impressive job of conveying estellas growing curiosity through her open face and subtle body language and our view of an australia only just on the edge of civilization comes through her eyes <>
that world is populated by wombats insects and even flowers which take on a kind of personality <>
however most significantly there are snakes and the linday compound is established as a kind of reverseeden where humans have the chance to return to a state of nature through acknowledgement of sensuality <>
the characters native to this world are frequently shown eating apples practically wallowing in their connection to original sin <>
lindsay challenges the christian notion of sin as linked to female sexuality and sirens is largely the playing out of that challenge <>
{1} at the same time the issue of artistic censorship is very much part of the subtext <>
the dinner table debates between anthony and lindsay frame the argument and while it is clear where duigans sentiments lie he doesnt turn anthony into a dogmaspouting stereotype <>
he presents the churchs case with a respect for its views and hugh grant is a charming and surprisingly hip spokesman <>
while the arguments are nothing special and in fact tend towards the cliche duigan treats the issue of art its influence on the public and the artists responsibility as a legitimate subject of debate <>
{2} if there is any fault to be found with duigans script its that he does skimp on his characters in the interest of establishing his analogy <>
the relationship between anthony and estella is not as wellestablished as it might be and lindsay himself is little more than a catalyst for estellas transformation <>
macpherson and fischer look good but theyre given too much to say and its never all that interesting when they do speak <>
however sirens does quite a lot with its visuals highlighting its glorious australian settings and it maintains a frisky sense of humor about its sensual subject matter without sniggering over it <>
those who might be looking for a leering sex romp should look elsewhere sirens is lyrical lively and thoughtful and always a feast for the senses <>

[2453/4]
{-1} i prefer my comedy with an edge <>
the war of the roses ruthless people and tvs the simpsons show that sometimes nothing is funnier than human nature at its nastiest <>
it is also the case that few comedy conventions irritate me more than starting with an edge and progressively dulling it with warmfuzziness <>
so here comes greedy a promising enough comedy about avaricious relatives but that fact that it was written by the popular team of lowell ganz and babaloo mandel splash parenthood city slickers should have clued me in that it wouldnt go for the jugular <>
there are fewer big laughs than in any of those films as a largely uninteresting cast tries gamely to support a limp story <>
{0} greedy describes most members of the mcteague family who want to get their hands on the millions of scrap metal king joe mcteague kirk douglas <>
nephews frank phil hartman carl ed begley jr and glen jere burns and their families are among those who make weekly trips to uncle joes mansion kissing up to the sickly old man and tearing each other down in an attempt to become his sole heir <>
there is a new obstacle on their latest visit molly olivia dabo a nubile young pizza delivery girl who has become uncle joes livein nurse <>
desperate to avoid being aced out the family locates favorite nephew danny michael j fox an earnest professional bowler who avoids the family and its infighting <>
they promise danny a cut of the inheritance of he can get rid of molly a deal which initially disgusts danny <>
however he gradually gets sucked in to the greedy mcteague world much to the consternation of girlfriend robin nancy travis <>
{-1} when it did work greedy let its nasty characters be their nastiest <>
the opening fifteen minutes focusing on one of the mcteague familys saturday gatherings offered a lot of laughs as they took turns revealing embarrassing secrets about each other to uncle joe <>
unfortunately none of the laughs are as big as they could have been and thats primarily because ganz and mandel dont provide their characters with distinct personalities except for siobhan fallons horrendously overboard drunk as hartmans wife <>
theyre all sort of interchangeably grasping and hartman begley and burns dont have enough manic energy on their own <>
while several of the lines are funny none of the characters is funny enough to give them a big push <>
{-1} after that early scene greedy loses almost all of the bite it might have had <>
michael j fox does a fine job of setting up the insecurity which will make danny vulnerable to the influence of his family but he isnt given the chance to sink his teeth into his own greed <>
either director jonathan lynn or fox himself wouldnt completely allow danny to get nasty <>
the result is that nothing he does seems particularly deserving of rebuke <>
when he tells his distraught girlfriend that hes just acting in uncle joes best interest i was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt <>
similarly olivia dabo is supposed to play a corrupted innocent but its hard to recognize where she changes because her character is never defined from the outset <>
apparently changing from a bikini to a macrame body suit is supposed to signal moral degredation <>
greedy wimps out when it should be emphasizing lust for money is damaging its characters <>
{-1} a simpler and more relevant criticism of greedy is that it really doesnt do anything new <>
greedy relatives and fights for an inheritance are film staples and most previous attempts have handled the subject better <>
by its conclusion greedy had become sort of a recycled willy wonka and the chocolate factory as michael j fox has to decide what to do with his particular everlasting gobstopper <>
greedy does offer a few giggles but they get buried under a fairly selfevident message and a slow unoriginal story <>
greedy is like a bottle of acid diluted in far too much water its just not corrosive enough <>

[2426/2]
{-2} scotts first law of hollywood auteurism reads as follows producerdirectorstar is a bad combination <>
many filmmakers need someone to be the voice of reason and that someone is usually the producer <>
the need can be even greater when the filmmaker in question is a rookie director which brings us to the first laws first corollary be especially wary when the name appearing three times before the title is seagal <>
on deadly ground marks action icon steven seagals first time in the directors chair and it looks like it <>
selfindulgent and deadly dull for at least half of its running time on deadly ground demonstrates why an ego like seagals needs something to keep it in check <>
{0} seagals standard issue taciturn buttkicker is this time called forrest taft an expert at putting out alaskan oil well fires <>
early in the film forrest is employed by aegis oil chief michael jennings michael caine to deal with an explosion at one of aegis rigs where it becomes evident that everything isnt up to specs on the wells safety equipment <>
furthermore it appears that the same equipment is to be used on a massive platform which must meet a startup deadline in order for aegis to retain the mineral rights <>
forrests life becomes forfeit when he discovers this information and jennings chief of security john c mcginley sets him up to die in an explosion <>
of course forrest escapes and hides out in an inuit village learning native environmental folklore <>
soon he sets out to make sure the aegis platform doesnt make its startup joined by a native activist joan chen <>
{-2} for those of you who didnt believe steven seagal could do anything more ineptly than he acts heres evidence to the contrary <>
he appears to have learned nothing about pacing and exposition from his two collaborations with andrew davis turning in an action film painfully short on action <>
the first hour is devoted to an overlong setup briefly interrupted by a barroom brawl so badly edited in places that they had to dub in exclamations so that it would be clear exactly where forrest is kicking his victims <>
we are subjected to a handful of soapbox speeches about environmental degradation including one in the middle of a thoroughly pointless dreamvision sequence <>
seagal seems to be laboring under the deluded impression that anyone who goes to see his films actually wants to hear him speak because for sixty minutes he just wont shut up <>
{-2} once it is revealed that surprise surprise forrest is a cia trained demolition expert and jennings sends a pack of professional killers out to eliminate him the action picks up <>
however almost none of it is inspired until forrest reaches aegis and almost invariably the editing is attrocious <>
lots of things blow up in on deadly ground but there is a so what quality to the pyrotechnics <>
still seagal at least could have had the sense to end the film with a bang instead of with a five minute monologue about the horrors of oil companies which rivals kevin costners jfk skreed for dramatic ineptitude <>
it isnt even the point that he may be right hes just chosen the wrong forum <>
{-1} of course the ultimate problem with any steven seagal project is that it must inevitably star steven seagal <>
where schwarzenegger entertains with his comic book persona and oneliners and stallone brings an underdog quality to his action flicks seagals squinting stoic is just boring <>
under siege at least had a chance thanks to tommy lee jones lively villain but michael caine is not in that league playing a nasty businessman weve seen a hundred times before <>
john c mcginley puts a nice spin on the enforcer role daring to lose his cool and admit hes no match for the hero <>
if directing on deadly ground is seagals idea of stretching himself id offer the words of laurence olivier as advice just act dear boy its much easier <>

[2395/4]
{-2} sometimes you can learn a lot about a film from its ad campaign <>
the television spots for romeo is bleeding featured a high energy rapidedit montage which made the film look like an allout action thriller the print ads on the other hand featured stylized renderings of the stars in a scene out of a s crime comic with critical blurbs in word balloons <>
and that about sums up whats wrong with romeo is bleeding <>
theres a fair amount of style and blackhumored mayhem but underneath it is a film that really doesnt seem to know whether it wants to be a noir thriller or a parody of a noir thriller and a script that is an absolute mess <>
{0} gary oldman stars as sgt jack grimaldi a new york cop with a wife annabella sciorra a mistress juliette lewis and ethics that are always for rent <>
although primarily assigned to watch over organized crime figures preparing to testify against their bosses his big money comes from one of those bosses a kingpin named falcone roy scheider who pays jack to reveal where the stool pigeons are roosting <>
falcones latest target is mona demarkov lena olin a psychotic hit person <>
mona offers jack not to reveal her whereabouts and to help her stage her death <>
jack soon realizes he cant have it both ways as falcone and mona begin closing in from opposite sides <>
{1} stylistically romeo is bleeding seems to be on the right track <>
director peter medak has two great films about british crime figures to his credit the krays and let him have it and shows hes studied his american gangster classics <>
the lighting is evocative the air is usually thick with cigarette smoke and trumpets and saxophones wail plaintively in the background <>
a running voiceover narrative by jack told in retrospect and in the third person achieves the right raymond chandleresque tone of impending doom <>
the stage is set to have some fun with film noir conventionsthe dumb blonde girlfriend the urbane mob bossbut thats not what happens <>
{-2} what does happen is that medak and screenwriter hilary henkin decide to serve up a freakedout combination of s and s crime film sensibilities sort of a what if quentin tarantino and abel ferrara collaborated on a phillip marlowe adaptation <>
consequently the tone of romeo is bleeding is radically uneven with moody conversations slamming into bloodspattered confrontations and characterizations which dont make a shred of sense <>
the most glaring and gruesome example of this confusion is lena olins mona who is part femme fatale and part terminator <>
there is no consistency to her actions as she goes to a macabre extreme to make her feigned death appear real then kidnaps the man she was supposedly trying to fool has his henchmen work for her and then turns herself in to the police <>
the only logic in romeo is bleeding is the logic of excess as the filmmakers abandon all pretense of telling a story in the name of the outrageous <>
{-2} structurally the script for romeo is bleeding is a disaster <>
one of the key points to the story is that jack sends his wife away for safety so that he can meet up with her later <>
this conversion comes out of nowhere to that point we had only seen a vague tolerance between them in a single scene and nothing to indicate that jack sincerely loved her <>
jack is developed in a careless haphazzard manner that left me without any concern for what happened to him <>
finally romeo is bleeding commits perhaps its most unpardonable sin with a final showdown between jack and mona which was so anticlimactic that i groaned out loud <>
at times the film seems to have been improvised as though in the middle of shooting someone would periodically say hey wouldnt it be cool to do this <>
romeo is bleeding looks good occasionally very good and olins performance is entertaining but the film also appears to have been edited with a knife and fork and amounts to little more than a series of loosely connected scenes with shock value <>

{2} i can thoroughly understand someone either loving or loathing mike leighs naked <>
on the one hand it is a rather unpleasant visceral experience with troubling images of violence against women on the other hand it is unflinching in its acidic humor and features a tourdeforce performance by david thewlis <>
yet for my money there is another level at which naked approaches brilliance <>
this film is a warning designed for the self rather than for society a startling examination of one minds response to dehumanization <>
{0} naked focuses its attention on johnny david thewlis an intelligent but extremely bitter drifter from manchester who takes off for london as the film opens <>
there he looks up old girlfriend louise lesley sharp but first finds her roommate sophie katlin cartlidge <>
they get along famously perhaps a bit too famously as sophie becomes rather clinging <>
johnny spends his days wandering through london sharing his unique philosophies with characters like brian peter wight a mildmannered night watchman <>
meanwhile louise and sophie have a runin with their sadomasochistic landlord sebastian hawkes greg cruttwell who makes himself a bit too much at home <>
{2} with johnny mike leigh has created a magnificent character who serves as a prophet of the apocalypse an apocalypse he describes in terms rather different from what one might expect <>
he is intensely aware that humans including himself are becoming something less than human and his commentary is filled with references to monkeys <>
as he watches brian perform his mundane job johnny notes that it could be done by a tall chimp <>
on another occasion louise asks him why are you such a bastard monkey see monkey do is his response <>
still later johnny asks sondra claire skinner louise and sophies highstrung third roommate about her experiences as a nurse is it true some babies are born with like fur all over them <>
and on and on too many instances to mention all connected to johnnys larger obsession with evolution <>
the fact is that in his own unique way johnny is a true optimist <>
when he preaches to brian about the end of humanity as we know it he is describing an event he looks forward to <>
we are not the ultimate expression of creation he realizes we are far too base <>
johnny acknowledges the animal aspect of his nature but he doesnt revel in it <>
when he speaks of our new form being like the angels he is speaking with hope and passion <>
the title of the film itself becomes an acknowledgement of our status in the universe when all the frills are stripped away were just big monkeys monkeys who seem to have stopped reaching for more <>
{2} all the brilliance in the world in the writing would have counted for little withough a perfect actor for johnny and david thewlis is that actor <>
his sarcastic often bilious musings easily could have come off as smug and selfcongratulatory but thewlis pours a great deal of emotion into his lines <>
yes he believes that he is more aware than those around him but he derives no pleasure from that knowledge instead finding only disgust with it <>
thewlis is supported by several other fine performances most notable claire skinners small but memorable role as the frantic sondra only cruttwell rings false with his slimy sebastian <>
{1} naked is not without its faults <>
an encounter between johnny and a young scots couple who cant seem to find one another is funny but doesnt really connect to the rest of the film <>
the sebastian character is way too much too crudely drawn to work as the representation of gilded brutishness he is meant to be <>
naked has a semblance of a narrative throughline but basically its a collection of snapshots viewed through johnnys singular lens and that collection can appear somewhat unfocused <>
but from its first jarring frames to its final shot of johnny limping down a london street it risks showing us the side of ourselves we dont like to see and hoping we wont turn away <>

{-1} good thrillers are hard to find and i am inordinately fond of good thrillers <>
in combination these two factors lead me to do things like give an rating to malice which i still defend incidently <>
the catharsis that a suspenseful tale provides seems to me to be the essence of what movies are for many viewers a visual rollercoaster <>
however far more common than good thrillers are slapdash wouldbe scarefests stitched together from other better films like some celluloid frankensteins monster <>
witness blink one part rear window two parts jennifer and one part from just about every suspense film cliche you could come up with if given a week to think about it <>
{0} blink tells the story of emma brody madeleine stowe a fiddle player in a celtic band who has been blind for twenty years <>
one day she receives a call from her doctor peter friedman that a cornea transplant donor is at last available <>
after the operation emma experiences an odd side effect a perceptual delay which causes things seen initially only as blurs to jump into focus in the mind hours or even days later <>
this perceptual delay occurs when she spots a serial killer leaving the scene of the crime in the apartment above her <>
she takes her information to det john hallstrom aidan quinn but her reliability as a witness is justifiably in question <>
however as hallstrom follows his only lead he also gets involved with her <>
soon it becomes clear that the killer knows there has been a witness and emma finds herself next on his list <>
{-1} there are some things that blink tries to do differently that show some early promise <>
as played by madeleine stowe emma spends her first few days with sight coming to terms with appearances as it matters to her for the first time whether she is considered pretty <>
its a nice bit of psychology for which i had high hopes <>
emmas distorted vision is captured by some nifty computer effects and dante spinottis eerie photography allowing us into her head quite effectively <>
its too bad that potential is wasted on such a positively bland story <>
for a thriller blink is almost completely lacking in tension its one good scare coming with emmas first recognition of the killers face <>
theres no opportunity to guess the killers identity either as clues yield a so what result <>
blink just trudges along focusing on a relationship between hallstrom and emma which makes no sense <>
{-2} what is most distressing about that relationship is that it cops out on its character development where it would have been most interesting <>
stowe shows the blind emma as confident and independent but without the omnipresent bitterness which characterizes so many blind screen characters then in a bit of irony which might have made o <>
henry smile she becomes dependent on others only when she can finally see <>
that internal conflict should have been the driving force behind her relationship with hallstrom while she needs the reassurance he gives her that shes desirable she hates that she needs that reassurance <>
but screenwriter dana stevens seems incapable of that level of subtlety and there seems to be no rhyme or reason to their eventual and inevitable coupling and subsequent conflict <>
it doesnt help that hallstrom is basically a blank and that quinn does nothing to make him particularly worth her time <>
{-2} if only that were the only fault in the script <>
we start with the nowubiquitous serial killer which if movies were to be believed are virtually on every street corner and head from there into cinemathrillerland <>
here dogs warn of impending danger but are heeded to late <>
here cops always fall for the women they are assigned to protect and viceversao here blind people always manage to have their final confrontations with the killer in the dark <>
here cops exchange dialogue like hallstrom she is the key detective ridgely to the case or to you <>
{-1} blink could have been a contender <>
the elements were there <>
it was just too slow to make any of them count and too timid to go to the soul of the characters <>

{1} i cant claim that my experience with french films has been all that extensive but the limited experience i have had has lent itself to the following stereotypical image two characters sitting in a dimly lit cafe smoking cigarettes and speaking cryptically to one another in extremely muted tones <>
these films tended to deal with emotionally stunted people in an emotionally stunted manner potentially intriguing but inert if not downright soporific <>
it caused me no end of amusement to find a scene exactly like the one i just described in krzysztof kieslowskis three colors blue <>
it caused me more pleasure to discover that scene only one part of a complex and fascinating character study of grief directed with a mesmerizing grace <>
so now i wonderis it french cinema that has changed or is it me <>
{0} three colors blue opens with a car crash which claims the life of renowned composer patrice de courcy and his fiveyearold daughter leaving wife julie juliette binoche as the only survivor <>
julie first considers suicide but eventually decides to sever all ties with her previous life and move into a small flat in paris <>
there she wishes nothing more than to spend the rest of her days doing nothing free of the loves and friendships she describes as traps <>
however she finds that freedom difficult as she develops a friendship with neighbor lucille charlotte very <>
when her husbands former partner olivier benoit regent goes public with his intention to complete patrices unfinished final concerto julie is forced to confront facts which might finally shake her from her reverie <>
{2} from a narrative standpoint blue is not the most easily accessible of films <>
there is very little dialogure in fact very little sound of any kind even the car crash is notable for its understatement <>
only the occasional explosions of zbigniew preisners score tend to break the silence loading the music with significance <>
kieslowski chooses to allow us into julies world almost entirely through images but how arresting those images are <>
in one scene julie sits in a cafe and listens to a street musician playing one of patrices compostions kieslowski indicates how long she stays simply through the changing shadows cast by julies coffee cup <>
another scene shows julie standing in her flat as a man runs down the hall banging on doors seeking help while being chased apparently by muggers <>
its a confident but rarely showy directing job by kieslowski allowing julies story to unfold slowly and clearly <>
{2} the centerpiece of blue is the performance of juliette binoche as julie and its a winner <>
while not the type of performance american film audiences are used to seeing it is nonetheless extremely effective <>
like many characters we saw in julie tries to make herself safe by placing herself in an emotional vacuum but she betrays her natural inclinations to reach out in scenes with her elderly mother and with lucille <>
at times the role might appear onenote yet there are deeper shadings <>
the early scene in which julie sleeps with olivier simply to provide him with closure to his previously unrequited love is strangely emotional <>
and her physical response to a group of young girls coming into the pool where she is swimming packs a punch <>
binoche proves herself as deserving as any actor this year of oscar consideration <>
{1} where blue is likely to irritate many is in the deliberate opaquity of some of its images <>
julies reaction to the discovery of a nest of mice in her apartment never really connects nor do the images of bungee jumping <>
a scene between julie and the young man who witnessed the car crash seems repetitive relevant only for the introduction of an object which will later prove significant <>
blue proves to be very slow going at times and requires immense patience <>
however as details concerning the relationship between julie and patrice unfold such patience will be proved worthwhile <>
three colors blue is an intensely focused examination of one womans attempt at selfdeception for her own perceived good and will likely stick with me for some time <>

{0} filmed and directed by dan geller and dayna goldfine <>
{-1} in the summer of eighty incoming stanford university freshman received a letter informing them of a unique opportunity <>
documentary filmmakers dan geller and dayna goldfine were planning to record their allfreshman dorm for the year and anyone who would feel uncomfortable with that arrangement was invited to switch to a different dorm <>
none so chose <>
the next nine months of their lives were saved for posterity as frosh an attempt to document a year when pupate human beings become adults <>
unfortunately its not particularly successful <>
frosh captures moments but due to its overly large canvas it doesnt capture enough growth <>
{0} frosh focuses its attention on nine of the eighty residents of stanfords trancos house <>
shayne a white catholic woman struggles to reconcile her religion with her budding feminism <>
cheng a first generation chineseamerican quips about stanfords liberal bias while coping with academic difficulties <>
brandi a middleclass africanamerican who admits early on that shes never really had black friends becomes friends with monique an africanamerican with a very different background <>
theres also nick an activist whos openly bisexual debbie a woman from a conservative religious background gerardo suspected by his dormmates of being gay scott a perceptive and sharpwitted africanamerican and sam a conservative white male who often finds himself at the center of controversy <>
{-1} i should preface my comments by stating that i spent three years in various capacities living in freshman dorms at stanford <>
i wasnt expecting to see anything id never seen before what i was expecting was a film that highlighted real growing experiences and allowed viewers to watch the first tentative steps of kids into adulthood <>
a few such moments in frosh work extremely well particularly shaynes emotional discussion with a few friends about why shes considering leaving the catholic church <>
another scene highlights monique describing her troubled home life prompting one young man to ask in amazement you mean your mom and dad were never married <>
but there arent enough of these moments <>
frosh seems more interested in being a kind of rapidly edited video yearbook and like most yearbooks its only going to be really significant to those who lived the moments <>
{-1} part of the problem with frosh is that even the ninestudent focus is too large <>
frosh will uncover an issue in one of their lives but doesnt take the time to show us the resolution <>
we never learn for example if at the end of the year shayne is still a churchgoing catholic we never learn how cheng recovers from his disappointing firstquarter grades <>
when its all said and done frosh comes off as an interesting anthropological footnote but not a particularly deep or insightful look at why the freshman year at a residential university is so significant <>
{-1} my primary bone of contention is that in its attempt to keep its brow relatively high frosh almost completely ignores two of the most challenging issues of the freshman year romantic relationships and substance use <>
there is one look at a blind date but little more <>
no one in frosh forms an indorm couple no one is shown locked out by an occupied roommate no one is shown breaking up with a high school sweetheart <>
these events are as formative as any late night discussion but frosh adopts a handsoff attitude <>
similarly while we witness a dorm party and a few subsequent hangovers we see no one dealing with the pressures to drink no one getting stoned for the first time <>
perhaps out of fear of scaring off their subjects geller and goldfine have excised most material parents wouldnt want to know <>
{-1} frosh does a nice job of capturing freshman in all their bombast and naivete <>
in one scene a professor tells debbie as she attempts to describe a term paper topic youre babbling in another one dormmate asks shayne if there was no like racism or sexism what would you talk about <>
where it comes up short is as an examination of how much an individual can change in these nine pivotal months <>
trust me i was there <>

{-2} wim wenders wings of desire was one of my favorite films of <>
as corny as it might sound i found it to be one of those rare transcendental film experiences a beautiful and poetic tale of love and human wonder that left me feeling uplifted <>
i was unsure of how to approach the idea that wenders was making a sequel to this singular film but i crossed my fingers and hoped for the best <>
unfortunately all the good will in the world was unable to salvage faraway so close <>
wenders seems to have been unclear as to what made wings of desire special weighing down a simple story with selfimportance and a ridiculously convoluted plot <>
{0} faraway so close returns otto sander to the role of cassiel one of many angels who drift through berlin observing and listening in on thoughts <>
he is curious about the human experience but reluctant to take the plunge risked by his former companion damiel bruno ganz <>
the decision is made for him when he becomes human to save the life of a young girl <>
cassiel resolves to use his physical form to intervene for good where he was unable to do so before but that resolution proves easier said than done <>
he falls into despair and loneliness eventually coming to work for a suave black marketeer horst buchholz <>
cassiel struggles to redeem himself all the while thwarted by a mysterious figure named emit flesti willem dafoe <>
{-1} like wings of desire faraway so close shows us the angels world in black and white and opens with loosely connected scenes of the angels smiling knowingly over human shoulders as they work and worry <>
but unless my memory fails me those scenes go on far longer in faraway and they become extremely tedious <>
they include a cameo by mikhail gorbachev thinking important thoughts about world peace and a scene involving a dying man and an angel played by nastassja kinski where the overlapping dialogue created a nightmare for the subtitler <>
this prologue seemed to go on and on and while it did provide information necessary later in the story it could have been done much more efficiently <>
there are too many characters many of whom are completely irrelevant to the story <>
{1} the films second act is by far its most effective <>
the reluctantly human cassiel copes poorly with his new state lacking the love which motivated damiels transformation <>
the marvelously expressive sander is great during these scenes drifting into drunken despondency with genuine pain <>
also intriguing is the relationship between cassiel and tony baker the germanborn americanraised racketeer who takes him in <>
horst buchholz has an oily charm as baker and theres a lively cadence to his perpetual switching back and forth between german and english <>
cassiel is most interesting when hes a fallen angel with baker the little devil on his shoulder <>
{-2} then during the climax it all falls apart again <>
willem dafoe who as emit flesti time itself backwards get it wanders through the film making ominous but opaque statements like time is the absence of money becomes thoroughly oppressive in the final half hour <>
faraway so close becomes a silly caper film involving stolen arms and kidnapping <>
peter falk who was so good in wings of desire as damiels guide to humanity is simply comic relief here although a scene involving the distraction of two security guards is very funny <>
wings of desire was whimsical but never dopey and faraway has a real problem finding its tone <>
{-2} perhaps the most egregious sin in faraway is a preachy epilogue that seems only tangentially connected to the film we just spent two and a half hours watching <>
wings of desire was a kind of message film but the message was skillfully delivered in the intervening five years wenders seems to have had all the subtlety sucked out of him <>
the moments that do work in faraway so close are mired in overplotting and theres never any flow to the story <>
whats worse it has tainted my memories of wings of desire <>
i think i need to rent it tonight <>

[2309/8]
{2} television has given the term situation comedy a bad name but that might be the most appropriate epithet for the snapper <>
this bright and earthy comedy from roddy doyle the commitments deals with an average irish family coping with one of lifes many little difficulties <>
theres no high concept no men in drag or mistaken identities <>
the snapper is just remarkably adept at making the mundane comic at making us laugh at real life <>
thanks largely to colm meaneys charming lead performance its just one of the most purely enjoyable comedies of <>
{0} the snapper is irish slang for a baby which is exactly what barrytown dublin resident sharon curley tina kellegher is expecting <>
the one small complication twentyyearold sharon is unmarried <>
her parents dessie colm meaney and kay ruth mccabe are more than understanding but they dont understand why sharon wont reveal the fathers name <>
her reluctance becomes clearer when george burgess pat laffan a paunchy married neighbor and the father of one of sharons friends drunkenly announces that sharon was a good ride <>
sharon denies that george is the father insisting instead on a onenight stand with a spanish sailor but soon all of barrytown is abuzz with the gossip causing great consternation in the curley household <>
{2} with such a simple premise execution becomes paramount and the snapper is very wellexecuted <>
director stephen frears dangerous liaisons hero keeps the comedy human by concentrating on faces and reactions a technique used most effectively during pub scenes where extreme closeups of drunken individuals emphasizes distorted perceptions <>
these are loud and boisterous characters a bit excessively so in the case of sharons cackling clique and frears allows this liveliness to permeate the film <>
without resorting to location cityscapes frears creates a rich atmosphere peopled with sparkling characters <>
{2} the standout among those characters is colm meaneys dessie <>
dessie is a unique creation a loving father and husband who avoids the slew of cliches typical of irish characters and father characters in general <>
yes he enjoys his pint at the pub with the boys but hes also attuned to modern sensibilities <>
times have changed he tells sharon in one scene <>
when craig was born i was at work when you were born i was at work when lisa was born i dont know where i was <>
meaney is perfect playing a more nuanced version of the same character he played in the commitments <>
his moments with sharon are wonderfully warm even through his frustration at the embarrassment her condition has caused him particularly good is a brief lowkey scene as dessie shares with sharon his amazement at the contents of a book on sexuality <>
hes also a man who genuinely loves his wife and you never doubt for a moment that dessie and kay have been married for twentyfive years <>
its a performance unlikely to garner much attention for award nominations but its as deserving of honors as any work out there <>
{-1} the rest of the cast is a bit more uneven <>
ruth mccabe is equal to meaney as the acerbic mother kay playing good cop to dessies bad cop <>
tina kellegher is fine when shes toned down but when she gets fiery she gets annoying <>
even more so is fionnuala murphy as sharons best friend jackie <>
pat laffans george burgess is a small role but he does quite a lot with it making george a rather pathetic figure <>
generally the snapper is better when its not in the pub and the volume knob on the characters is turned down <>
{2} some viewers may be made uncomfortable by the circumstances surrounding sharons sexual encounter but i found the story depended on those circumstances and that sharons response to her situation defined her character <>
the snapper doesnt moralize it just sets up a scenario and lets characters react <>
i found those reactions extremely funny although i needed to break out my irish toamerican profanity dictionary on more than one occasion <>
youll need to play close attention to pick up all the dialogue in the snapper but it will be well worth the effort <>

[2304/4]
{-2} the pelican brief has a lot in common with this summers the firm <>
of course both are based on uberbestsellers by john grisham but the similarities run deeper than that <>
the firm starred hollywoods most marketable male star tom cruise the pelican brief grabbed the most marketable female star julia roberts <>
both were directed by prestige directors and both were constructed from the slicker is better model of thrillermaking <>
in short the pelican brief might as well be the firm an overlong overplotted instantly forgettable entertainment sporadically enlivened by decent supporting performances <>
unfortunately it doesnt have gene hackman <>
{0} the pelican brief opens with the assassination of two supreme court justices who appear to have little in common one an aging liberal and the other a young conservative <>
however a possible link is discovered by darby shaw julia roberts a law student at tulane university <>
through her law professorlover thomas callahan sam shepard darbys theory which comes to be known as the pelican brief is circulated in washington <>
among its implications are possible connections between the assassinations and the president robert culp and suddenly people start turning up dead <>
a frightened darby turns to gray grantham denzel washington a white house reporter investigating the assassinations and soon the two are running for their lives desperately searching for proof of their theory before they too are added to the growing body count <>
{-2} technically the pelican brief is just fine <>
director alan j pakula all the presidents men presumed innocent knows how to ratchet up the tension using pullback crane shots to heighten the sense of paranoia <>
james horners score works well even if it does depend overmuch on dissonant piano chords and wood block percussion <>
the problem with the pelican brief the movie is the same thing thats wrong with the pelican brief the book theres not a single interesting or original thing happening either from a story or character perspective <>
the big conspiracy at the heart of the story is both insipid and insulting to ones intelligence <>
its impossible to accept that no one considered the possibility of spacing out the assassinations or being slightly more creative than putting a bullet in the head of a man who was on a respirator <>
theres only one possible reason for such stupidity there wouldnt have been anything for a clever law student to sniff out <>
its equally ludicrous to suggest that no one else in federal law enforcement would have considered the possibilities darby shaw comes up with <>
grishams story is loaded with implausibilities and the payoff it offers for accepting them is simply not worth it <>
{-1} the characters in pakulas adaptation dont fare much better <>
julia roberts chose darby shaw as her first role in two years but its difficult to figure out why <>
there is not a shred of back story nothing to suggest why she pursues the assassination story nothing to make her anything but a positively bland lady in distress <>
to her credit roberts reaction to an explosion is gripping and shes thoroughly convincing at suggesting dazed trauma but dazed and traumatized is about as fara as this role goes <>
denzel washington one of the most talented and charismatic leading men around has an equally blank slate with gray grantham somehow he manages to act circles around a part where theres really nothing there <>
up and down the cast its the same story tony goldwyn is the presidents shadowy chief of staff john lithgow is washingtons skeptical editor stanley tucci is the icy killer <>
only hume cronyn in a single scene as the aging justice rosenberg has any spark <>
no one else has a thing to work with <>
{-1} the firm was no piece of art but at least its characters were reasonably fleshed out for the screen <>
the pelican brief asked me to sit through nearly two and a half hours of repetitive chases involving people i didnt care about <>
a third grisham adaptation the client is on its way next year <>
i suppose its too much to ask that hes learned to write an interesting story by now <>

[2272/4]
{-2} every once in a while i come upon a movie where i simply cant get beyond the basic premise as well as certain individual elements might be executed im so turned off by that premise that i cant possibly enjoy the film <>
such was the case with last years radio flyer where children in a dysfunctional household were used as the launching pad for an adventure <>
now comes josh and sam similarly focused on the exploits of two troubled kids and again my rejection mechanism kicked in <>
there is some charm to be found in the performances but overall it simply depressed me and wrapped up a disturbing package far too neatly <>
{0} josh and sam is the story of two children struggling to cope with their parents divorce <>
yearold josh jacob tierney is a shy computer whiz who prefers living with mom yearold sam noah fleiss is a fightprone daydreamer who enjoys time with dad stephen tobolowsky <>
on one visit with their fathers new family in florida tensions boil over between the brothers and josh convinces sam that hes a strategically altered mutant or sam josh uses the deception in an attempt to run away but instead the boys end up on the road together depending on each other and a friendly hitchhiker martha plimpton <>
{-2} josh and sam hinges on the fact that sam almost immediately believes the improbable story that he is a genetically engineered fighter the evidence consisting of documents that josh has mocked up on his fathers computer <>
its a stretch to accept that sam would buy such a ridiculous concept especially when he knows his brother is so adept with computers <>
screenwriter frank deese attempts to bypass this plausibility problem by having sam say that the fact that he is an sam explains why he thinks about being dead all the time <>
suddenly josh and sam becomes the tale of a cruel prank perpetrated on a deeply disturbed little boy and it becomes extremely unpleasant to watch <>
these problems are further compounded when josh and sam aims for an inappropriately upbeat conclusion <>
the two children are repeatedly treated with cruelty and inconsideration by their parents and extended families and these issues are almost completely glossed over <>
dad makes a relatively sincere apology but for a film which uses serious family problems to set up its hijinks its disappointingly timid in dealing with the repercussions <>
{-2} its dark undertones are not the only problem with josh and sam however <>
a certain amount of contrivance is practically required in capers such as this but josh and sam really pushes the envelope <>
the event which forces josh to run is a strained sequence involving chris penn as a drunken texan and he really doesnt work <>
most baffling is the role played by martha plimpton an illdefined runaway who appears and disappears without leaving any recognizable imprint on the story <>
somewhere in that character was a relevant backstory but it never made it to the screen <>
there is even a tossedoff attempt to make her a romantic interest for josh which is raised and resolved in under five minutes of screen time <>
josh and sam asks for far too much leeway and offers far too little reward in return <>
{-1} as disturbed and disappointed as i was in the story i have to acknowledge the appeal of the two lead performances <>
jacob tierney is very good as the bright and resourceful josh best of all in the obligatory fool the stupid cop sequence and noah fleiss brings real heartbreak to the truly confused sam <>
the two are convincing brothers throughout and i liked the rapport between them <>
still i found myself dwelling on its handling of a serious subject matter in a manner i found inappropriate <>
there is no such thing as an objective review but in this case i cant even pretend otherwise <>
i found nothing fun about watching two kids in desperate need of therapy taking a joy ride <>

{1} lets face it kevin costner hasnt become one of the most popular movie stars in the world because he can act the hell out of a part <>
sure hes been charming enough in light fare like silverado and bull durham but hes done little to prove that his ideal dramatic role wasnt as the corpse in the big chill <>
it therefore might not seem to mean much to say that a perfect world features costners best allaround performance yet and indeed its nothing earthshattering <>
however its more than solid and coupled with an impressive turn by yearold t j lowther creates a haunting story that packs a real punch even through its superfluous subplot <>
{0} costner stars as butch haynes a recidivist criminal who escapes from a texas prison with his cellmate on halloween <>
in the course of their escape they take as a hostage young philip perry lowther a fatherless boy raised in a strict jehovahs witness household <>
in pursuit is texas ranger red garnett clint eastwood a veteran lawman forced to team up with young criminologist sally gerber laura dern <>
soon butch and philip are on their own and begin to form an attachment butch acting as a surrogate father to philip and philip reminding butch of his own troubled youth <>
as the unlikely pair head out of texas they head also for a showdown with red and with butchs confrontation with his own tortured past <>
{-1} screenwriter john lee hancock makes one big mistake and thats spending so much time and the tired and uninteresting subplot focusing on the law enforcement in pursuit of butch <>
it seems in the early stages that hes setting up a parallel or is interested in creating a hunterhunted conflict a la the fugitive but neither reall proves true <>
instead we get cliched characters in cliched conflicts <>
theres an icy fed to get on reds nerves and plenty of pithy good ol boy wisdom dispensed <>
eastwood and dern toss off token lines of goodnatured antagonism but neither one is interesting enough to make their story at all significant <>
a tighter potentially classic drama might have come from chopping their segments entirely because the main plot is a gem <>
{1} the relationship between butch haynes and philip perry is one of the most unique and interesting explored in recent years <>
while at first glance butch might seem to be a simple victim of a negative environment type hes more complicated than that <>
the picture that develops of his father is far from clear making butch a less than reliable narrator <>
his attachment to philip is based on the worst memories of his father yet it is his father he seeks throughout <>
a perfect world plays out like an extended therapy session for butch as he attempts through philip to create the perfect childhood he could not have for himself <>
costner captures a surprising amount of nuance in his portrayal of butch one minute the doting father the next an edgy psychotic <>
its a radical change of pace for costner and he pulls it off perhaps the larger credit for a perfect worlds success is t j lowther <>
hes not asked to say much but his expressive face becomes one of the most vital elements in the film <>
the relationship between butch and philip is the heart of a perfect world and its nearly perfectly executed <>
{1} director eastwoods first outing since his oscar for unforgiven is a similarly dark piece about a struggle for redemption and while the whole may not be as strong as last years best picture winner some of the moments are even better <>
the opening sequence is instantly gripping and a long shot of butch and philip walking through a field the boy repeatedly attempting to hold the criminals hand is wonderful <>
the best sequence comes near the end as an idyllic waltz quickly turns into a remarkably intense confrontation <>
eastwood draws out the ending a bit too long but by that point i was more than willing to stick with butch and philip <>
{1} a perfect world is really two films <>
one is mediocre at best but the other is one of the best films of the year <>
together they still add up to one of the better films of the year <>

{1} if you want big emotions you want steven spielberg if its understated sentimentality youre looking for you call tony bill <>
from s my bodyguard through the recent untamed heart bill has demonstrated a skill with emotional stories that steer clear of maudlin excess <>
as one who enjoys feeling without feeling manipulated i find that a pretty neat trick <>
a home of our own is an extremely appealing lowkey family drama driven by kathy bates rocksolid lead performance which adds to bills growing resume of restrained character pieces <>
{0} bates plays frances lacey a hardworking widow trying to raise six children alone in <>
after losing a job in a potato chip plant frances decides to move the family from los angeles much to the dismay of oldest son shane edward furlong <>
they set out with no specific destination and virtually no money winding up in rural idaho <>
there she spots an unfinished house owned by mr moon soonteck oh and manages to barter chores for the opportunity to live in and repair it <>
she takes a job at a local bowling alley and slowly but surely begins working towards her dream of settling her family into a life with some kind of future in a home of their own <>
{2} a home of our own plays a lot like an impoverished wonder years with its s setting and wry retrospective narration but unlike that series the voiceover is rarely intrusive and doesnt draw the focus away from frances <>
as played by kathy bates frances is the heart and soul of the family and the film a woman so determined to make it on her own terms that she occasionally loses sight of whats best for her children <>
bates is near perfect a presence that commands respect one is hardpressed to think of another actor who would be as convincing as a sane mother of six <>
her slightly weathered features convey years of struggle but she maintains an earthy good humor and a relentless optimism borne of necessity <>
{1} that kathy bates gives a great performance cant be considered much of a surprise <>
what is a pleasant surprise is a home of our owns realistic portrayal of family life in hardship <>
with the exception of edward furlong the lacey children are played by firsttime actors and they are quite natural <>
scenes are filled with petty squabbles but beneath them all is a kind of solidarity which never seems mockheroic <>
there is a level of love and mutual respect in the interaction which frankly threw me <>
its not often that a movie does an american family this kind of justice <>
{-1} like most of tony bills work a home of our own is best when its quietly observant <>
there are a few big confrontations and they seem forced primarily due to furlongs histrionics <>
young actors tend to get into a lot of trouble when theyre asked to yell or to deliver lines like you care more about the house than you do about us and this is no exception <>
the film also trips when it spends too much time away from kathy bates such as a tackedon sequence involving furlongs first date <>
i was a bit disappointed in the inspirational finale which loses some of the integrity points that home had accrued <>
its the small family moments particularly the car trip to idaho and a visit to a church thrift store which really won me over <>
{1} i shouldnt forget the nice performance of soonteck oh as mr moon munimura the lonely gardener who finds a new family in the laceys <>
i wish the filmmakers had done less with furlongs character and more with his the one through whom we can see the familys struggle with somewhat objective eyes <>
wholesome is a word that usually inspires derision but i couldnt be more complimentary when i say that a home of our own is a wholesome subtly emotional film wellacted and skillfully directed <>

{-2} point raymond carver purists might be extremely disappointed in what robert altman has done to some of the best short stories written in the english language <>
the interlocking story structure of short cuts does not serve those stories well and the small pathos of carvers pacific northwest isnt the same in altmans los angeles <>
{1} point short cuts stands independently as a splendid film achievement a brutally funny collection of fragments from broken lives crafted by a director with renewed vitality <>
only an abiding cynicism and the uneven appeal of the nine main stories mar this dynamic poetic work <>
{0} short cuts follows characters through four days in contemporary los angeles howard and ann finnigan bruce davison andie macdowell are an upscale couple whose young son is hit by a car driven by doreen piggot lily tomlin <>
doreen is a waitress with a drunken husband tom waits and a disaffected daughter honey lili taylor <>
honey is married to hollywood makeup artist bill robert downey jr and best friends with jerry and lois chris penn jennifer jason leigh <>
howard and anns son is cared for by dr ralph wyman matthew modine who is married to aspiring artist marion julianne moore <>
marions sister sherri madeleine stowe is married to philandering cop gene tim robbins whos having an affair with betty frances mcdormand much to the dismay of bettys estranged husband stormy peter gallagher <>
also in the milieu are the finnigans next door neighbors a night club singer annie ross and her cellist daughter lori singer and claire and stuart kane anne archer fred ward a clown and her unemployed husband <>
{1} short cuts is about those moments when individuals are at their most basic naked and vulnerable <>
indeed nakedness and scatology play a key role in the film perhaps more than some viewers might find palatable <>
characters in short cuts pop zits break wind urinate into streams talk bluntly about sexuality and wander around in various states of undress but none of these elements ever seem gratuitous <>
these are the hidden moments when men and women reveal themselves full of insecurity guilt and fear and short cuts captures them with a stunning grace <>
in one of the films most memorable moments julianne moore stands before husband matthew modine making a painful confession with evidence that she is a natural redhead in full view <>
in another scene bruce davison squirms while his father marvelously played by jack lemmon describes the tryst that led to his estrangement from his family thirty years before <>
this is a film loaded with individual moments that slam home with the intensity of reality recognized and frequently inspire nervous laughter <>
{-1} in my estimation however altman erred in the decision to interlock his stories <>
while the structure serves a purpose in emphasizing a great tapestry of lives the impact of carvers individual stories is largely lost <>
neighbors in which a couple begins living vicariously through the apartment they are taking care of is reduce to a couple of white trash folk messing up a nice place collectors becomes a single scene with a doortodoor vacuum cleaner salesman <>
its true that im criticizing the film short cuts is not rather than the film it is but it just seems a shame that such rich source material is given such a cursory treatment <>
altman never seems to identify with his own characters the way carver did and as a result it seems hes laughing at them and not with them <>
{1} opinions will vary as to which stories worked best <>
i cast my lot for the most faithful of the adaptations so much water so close to home in which fred ward buck henry and huey lewis discover a dead body while on a fishing trip <>
a small good thing also scores big point from the fine performances of andie macdowell as the nervous mother jack lemmon in the previously noted turn as bruce davisons father and lyle lovett in a quirky appearance as a baker with a mean streak <>
the two big losers are neighbors and the one story created wholly by altman the relationship between a boozy singer and her daughter which tries to fit in but always seems obviously out of place <>
the valleys however are few and the peaks are massive <>
at over three hours short cuts is anything but boring <>
its a sharp clever perceptive look at life in the big city that goes for the jugular rather than the heartstrings <>
these short cuts are somewhat cold cuts but theyre mighty tasty <>

[2217/4]
{-2} its about fifteen minutes into flesh and bone before you see the first speck of sunlight or hear the first note of underscore <>
in fact theres almost no movement or sound of any kind <>
its clear from the outset that writerdirector steve kloves the fabulous baker boys is going for a dark and moody feel <>
however theres moody and then theres comatose <>
flesh and bone is the perfect example of a solid story choking nearly to death on its own atmosphere <>
{0} flesh and bone opens with a rural texas family taking in an apparently homeless boy for the night <>
in fact the boy is the son of a thief who has fequently pulled this con letting his dad into homes after everyone is asleep <>
this time the robbery is botched and three members of the family are slain leaving only an infant girl <>
thirty years later grownup arlis sweeney dennis quaid is eking out a living running a vending machine supply business content with a simple predictable life <>
while on a job he meets kay davies meg ryan a runaway wife jumping drunkenly out of a cake at a bachelor party <>
arlis brings kay along on his rounds and an attraction grows <>
trouble also grows when papa roy james caan reappears linked up with a slick young grifter gwyneth paltrow <>
despite every attempt to distance himself from his past arlis finds himself drawn into his fathers obsession with tying up loose ends <>
{-1} at the heart of flesh and bone is an intriguing character in an intriguing premise <>
arlis sweeney is a man desperately trying to convince himself that hes not like his father trying to live out his days meekly as a personal penance for whatever crimes he might have been party to <>
he feels completely unworthy of the tootrusting kay giving their relationship a nice dynamic <>
unfortunately dennis quaid is playing arlis <>
as charming as he can be quaid simply doesnt have the dramatic range necessary to dig into this complicated character when he should be looking introspective and guiltridden he just looks stiff <>
i was left imagining a jeff bridges in the role and what might have been given a more versatile actor <>
{-1} other aspects of the performances also left me unsatisfied <>
meg ryan has the light touch required for the films few moments of humor but she doesnt quite strike the balance of strength and accumulated pain required for this role <>
james caan has a surprisingly small part given his prominence in the advertising campaign and never quite hits his stride <>
his performance is too mannered full of odd jaw movements and rolled eyes <>
its a major drawback because caans roy is supposed to be flesh and bones living manifestation of evil and hes nowhere near threatening enough <>
surprisingly the best performance is turned in by gwyneth paltrow as the savvy gennie but its hard to figure what purpose her character serves other than perhaps to remind arlis of what he could be <>
{-2} for all the problems with the acting its another issue entirely that proves to be flesh and bones ultimate undoing its positively snoreinducing <>
at two hours and ten minutes its at least twenty minutes too long <>
the second act is interminable chock full of scenes best left on the cutting room floor like kays confrontation with her husband apparently a refugee from thelma and louise <>
there were establishing shots which lasted twice as long as necessary and meaningful pauses which werent very meaningful <>
to make matters worse there were two minute stretches of dialogue between caan and quaid which were practically indecipherable im not sure whether to blame the sound mixing or the theater for that one <>
in live theater there is an expression tighten it up what flesh and bone needed was a good tightening up <>
{-1} the tone that flesh and bone is going for is fully achieved <>
the west texas locations are expertly captured by cinematographer phillippe rousselot and the spare score by thomas newman has a nice edgy feel <>
everything is working towards a grim tension and it succeeds but tension requires release and its there that flesh and bone doesnt deliver <>
thanks to an illconceived ad campaign one of the films key plot points is given away in the trailers blowing one of those release points for anyone who has seen them <>
there is a great deal of craft to the broad strokes of flesh and bone <>
however in this tale of evil the devil is truly in the lack of details <>

{0} john boyz james legros is floundering <>
in the days immediately following the rodney king verdict riots los angeles resident john is unemployed plagued by insomnia and filled with an overwhelming sense of despair <>
and thats the good news <>
in the course of one day john finds his meager savings confiscated by the irs his unemployment benefits cut off his girlfriend in bed with another man and his strung out brother in need of a detox program <>
teetering on the edge of sanity john finds himself on a comic odyssey dominated by the spectre of class revolution and the visage of fascistic police chief merryl fence nelson lyon <>
{1} this is the first directorial effort by peter mccarthy producer of such films as repo man and tapeheads and those credits should tell you all you need to know about the style and tone of floundering <>
its a hilariously surreal examination of urban paranoia and hopelessness filled with oddball characters goofy streamofconsciousness narrative and instantly quotable lines <>
floundering is told through a voiceover narration by john but its not so much about john as it is about the chaotic world around him <>
john is only the tour guide but his observations are wonderfully offthewall <>
{1} on the destruction in south central la maybe we should leave it as a reminderthen peter ueberroth will turn it into a riot theme park <>
{1} on romance true love is the ultimate fictionif you ever walk into a room and find yourself instantly attracted to someone get out of that room as fast as you can <>
{1} on a sign in a bakery that reads please dont feed the homeless beggars who the h should you feed <>
{0} mccarthys script is rich with such moments <>
unfortunately its also rich with heavyhanded leftwing moralizing which could easily turn off those with differing points of view <>
characters representing the system like chief fence and johns teacher turnedcorporate bigwig friend doug are essentially cardboard cutouts used to mouth opposing dogma <>
its therefore very fortunate that so many of the other minor roles are so funny <>
many of them are played by name actors in cameos like john cusack as a philosophical partygoer steve buscemi as a friend of johns angry about child slavery rings and ethan hawke as johns paranoid brother <>
{1} in the middle of it all is james legros as john who adapts an appropriately blank young everyman quality <>
hes a guy with a good heart who finds himself overwhelmed by the apparent injustices in his world and his feelings of powerlessness to do anything about it <>
the snapshots taken by his mental camera provide a bitingly satirical collage of urban life but surprisingly mccarthy doesnt opt for utter cynicism <>
instead he manages to balance blackhumored sarcasm and social commentary with an ultimately optimistic message of personal responsibility <>
for those who enjoy their comedy with an edge and dont mind the occasional preaching theres a real winner to be found in floundering <>
{1} besides how can you not love a film that ends with two guitarists one black and one white singing a marvelously offkey duet of whats so funny bout peace love and understanding <>

{-2} i knew i was in trouble in the beverly hillbillies when joke involved stomping a bear in the groin <>
joke covered the expulsion of bodily gasses <>
the portion of the audience that was years old either chronologically or intellectually howled with delight <>
i merely sat in astonished silence and prepared for a very long ninety minutes <>
{0} the film version of the beverly hillbillies doesnt stray far from the premise of the television series <>
jed clampett jim varney stumbles upon a billion dollar reservoir of crude oil while hunting in arkansas then decides to move to california with spunky daughter elly may erika eleniak irrascible granny cloris leachman and lunkhead nephew jethro diedrich bader <>
the reason for the move widower jed wants to find a new wife and educate tomboyish elly may in the ways of a refined woman <>
in beverly hills jed entrusts his fortune to bank president milburn drysdale dabney coleman and his unctuous assistant miss jane hathaway lily tomlin <>
meanwhile bank toady tyler rob schneider and his golddigging girlfriend laura lea thompson hatch a plan to have laura pose as a french governess for elly may insinuating herself into the clampetts good graces as well as their checkbook <>
{1} the real star of the beverly hillbillies is casting director glenn daniels who has put together about as perfect a physical match for the cast of the series as i could imagine <>
simply admiring cloris leachmans remarkable resemblance to the late irene ryan was enough to inspire me to grant hillbillies about ten minutes of good will <>
unfortunately that turned out to be nine minutes too much <>
as eager as the performers seem to be to throw themselves into their roles theyre just not given anything remotely interesting to do <>
{-2} congratulate lawrence konner and mark rosenthal who receive story and coscreenwriting credit for pulling off a challenging task coming up with a script even more pedestrian than their work in for love or money <>
they aim their jokes so far below the belt that they usually end up somewhere around the ankles <>
the addams family approach is clearly in evidence here namely to come up with a gauzethin story then turn the characters loose to ham it up in comic strip fashion <>
the beverly hillbillies maintains a fairly consistent pattern of setupsetupgag setupsetupgag where you can see hear and smell every one coming from several miles away <>
the series ran for ten years theres just not much new ground to cover in the rednecks among the ritzy department <>
its therefore not much of a surprise that the few really fresh and funny moments dont involve the hillbillies at all watch instead if watch you must for some sharp jabs at beverly hills high school students <>
these laughs are so rare i wont spoil them by name <>
{-2} as in her hit waynes world director penelope spheeris seems to wallow in intertextuality we get references to jeopardy peoples court barnaby jones and deliverance just to name a few and none of them are funny <>
spheeris seems to be making the mistaken assumption that referentiality is funny in its own right regardless of context forgetting that waynes world worked because it was about the pop culture awareness of the twentysomethings <>
theres none of that goofy selfawareness in the beverly hillbillies just a plodding almost smug conviction that it will be a hit no matter what kind of garbage they throw at the audience <>
it would be nice to see them proved wrong <>
{-2} sadly the beverly hillbillies seems destined to attract the same audience that made the addams family a hit a combination of nostalgic parents and easilyamused kids <>
for nostalgia watch the series in syndicated reruns for free for the kids just give them a good book theyll thank you for it later <>

[2166/3]
{-1} michael j fox is in a deep rut <>
while hes made the occasional stab at drama light of day casualties of war fox has basically seemed content to play the character he perfected on family ties the cocky young gogetter who learns a lesson about what really matters <>
its a type that has worked for him thanks to his charm and comic timing <>
but it puts him in danger of carrying questionable projects which seem comfortable <>
as a perfect example witness for love or money a clichefilled wouldbe romantic comedy thats neither particularly romantic nor particularly funny <>
{0} this time around foxs cocky young gogetter is named doug ireland concierge at the posh manhattan hotel the bradbury <>
his specialty is doing that little something extra for the guestswalking their dogs acquiring hardtoget theater ticketsand raking in huge tips for his efforts <>
these tips have gone into a deposit on dougs dream his own luxury hotel but making that dream a reality will require another million <>
enter financier christian hanover anthony higgins whos willing to exchange helping doug with his hotel with doug helping him carry on an affair <>
the catch hanovers mistress is andy gabrielle anwar an aspiring singer who works at the bradburys perfume counter and for whom doug is carrying a torch <>
as the two spend more time together a mutual attraction develops forcing doug to decide whether hes willing to sacrifice hanovers money for andys love <>
{-2} if you have to guess which choice doug will make you havent seen very many romantic comedies <>
the point is never whether theyll end up together but simply how entertaining getting there will be <>
unfortunately the answer in for love or money is not very <>
it starts promisingly enough with a focus on dougs wheeling and dealing but once the romantic plot kicks in theres just no energy <>
theres a lengthy sequence at a party involving mistaken identities and doug trying to hold everything together which was frantic but never really clicked after that the film doesnt even seem to try <>
the situations are simply tedious <>
i cant begin to describe how tired i am of that stock we both care about each other but neither one of us will admit it so instead well yell at each other scene in romantic comedies <>
there are plenty of ways to establish conflict that actually occur in human life or perhaps i and everyone i know have just been lucky so far <>
for love or money uses up most of its best jokes and all of its originality in about ten minutes <>
{-2} i also had many problems with the performances <>
fox has spent so much time as the cocky young gogetter that he doesnt seem to know how to vary it <>
hes too likable too soon for love or money would have worked much better if a man who had seen more than his share of kept women had initially been more cynical and antagonistic towards andy <>
he also never conveys when the mild flirtation established early in their interaction becomes real romantic interest but perhaps a better question than when is why <>
gabrielle anwar wanders through the film gorgeous but thoroughly uninteresting emoting and pouting in ways that would make a high school drama teacher cringe <>
of the supporting players only michael tucker as a nebbishy hotel guest is not a complete stereotype <>
particularly embarrassing are fascistic german hotel manager and a swishy fashion designer but they are just the most glaring examples of a script that makes all the easy choices and all the wrong ones <>
{-2} director barry sonnenfeld was a marvelous cinematographer millers crossing <>
but so far only a barely serviceable director <>
like the addams family for love or money is too hamfisted and sonnenfelds few stylistic flourishes are lost in slow pacing and mishandled actors <>
for love or money turns out to be alex keaton the concierge years an overlong midgrade sitcom <>

[2162/6]
{1} youd think disney could mail it in by now <>
underdog makes good comedies have been a staple of the studios liveaction repertoire from the absentminded professor to gus to the mighty ducks <>
that a significant portion of their audience wouldnt notice if they did mail it in makes it all the more impressive that they dont <>
cool runnings carries on a tradition of formula comedies exuding goodnatured energy and entertaining more than they have any right to <>
{0} as advertised cool runnings tells the story sort of behind the first jamaican olympic bobsled team <>
derice brannock leon is a sprinter with olympic dreams whose dream is shattered when he and two other runners stumble during the final qualifying trials <>
unwilling to give up on the chance to be an olympian derice considers another sport bobsledding <>
along with best friend sanka coffie doug e doug derice looks up irving blitzer john candy a twotime bobsled gold medalist disgraced by a cheating scandal and quietly going to seed in jamaica <>
blitzer reluctantly agrees to coach the team made up of derice sanka and the two other fallen sprinters surly baldheaded yul malik yoba and passive rich kid junior rawle e lewis <>
they train and head to calgary for a chance to qualify for the winter games <>
{2} anyone who has ever seen a disney sports film or almost any sports film for that matter can tell you more or less exactly what to expect <>
the coach will be gruff towards his inept new charges do you think hell eventually warm up to them <>
there will be a montage of the team in training or playing their sport do you think theyll keep improving <>
there will be a hissable cartoonish villain who questions our heroes mettle do you think hell get his comeuppance <>
no one goes to these films to be overwhelmed by the originality of the story <>
its all about positive feeling and cool runnings delivers it <>
the slapstick training runs are lively enough so that the youngsters in my audience were screaming with delight <>
the bobsled footage is superb and the olympic village atmosphere is exciting <>
jamaica is disneyfied into an idealized colorful paradise replete with grinning waifs and free of most signs of poverty but its brightly filmed and after all this isnt a film which offers much in the way of social commentary <>
{2} the performers are responsible for generating most of the charm each member of the team handling his stock part with aplomb <>
leon is a bit stiff but still appealing as the determined team leader <>
malik yuba glowers and grumbles effectively as yul and rawle e lewis junior is jittery and expressive <>
doug e doug gets the comic relief role as sanka and proves to be a winning presence <>
the biggest surprise however is john candy <>
in the past candys name in the credits has been almost as sure a sign of a comedy <>
ill hate as mickey rourkes has been of a drama ill hate <>
here candy plays the straight man instead of the buffoon and plays it well <>
it doesnt take much imagination to buy candy as a hasbeen anything but hes more than just serviceable <>
he plays blitzer surprisingly understated even when giving the obligatory inspirational speeches and allows the rest of the cast to carry most of the comedy <>
{1} i could spend plenty of time nitpicking about what cool runnings didnt do or should have done <>
the real story behind the formation of the team is far less hollywood and thats not the only historical fact with which the film plays fast and loose <>
the nasty east german bobsledder and the us official with a grudge are both way over the top <>
but for my money the most important factor was that i left the theater smiling and feeling uplifted <>
its a film about success coming from hard work and determination and its a film i would be glad to take a family to see <>
thats a rarity and its worth praise on its own level <>

[2150/8]
{2} it has long been my belief that the best movie mysteries are those after which you can say to yourself i should have figured that out <>
i loathe joe eszterhasstyle thrillers which make me feel as though ive been had nothing that can change the whodunnit by shooting five new minutes of footage is constructed tightly enough <>
almost equally annoying are those which seem to twist and turn just for the sake of twisting and turning forcing you to engage in a twohour discussion with your fellow moviegoers just to figure out what the heck you just saw <>
malice avoids all these pitfalls <>
this is a sharp artfullyconstructed thriller a snappy entertainment that does everything i ask a film in its genre to do keep me guessing without manipulating me <>
{0} andy safien bill pullman is a student dean at westerly college a picturesque new england campus plagued by a string of serial rapes <>
while following up on the latest assault andy meets dr jed hill alec baldwin a cocky new thoracic surgeon who turns out to be an old high school classmate of andys <>
andy soon invites jed to move into the house being remodeled by andy and his wife tracy nicole kidman in an attempt to defray expenses <>
tracy is nonetoopleased by jeds playboy manner an added burden to the chronic abdominal pain she is experiencing <>
however life in the safien household will soon go from bad to worse <>
andy becomes a suspect in the rapes and tracy suffers a severe medical emergency forcing jed to make a decision which will set in motion a serpentine chain of danger and deceptions <>
{2} this is the point where reviewing a film like malice gets tricky <>
comment on the plot is next to impossible particularly on those few points where i felt credibility is stretched <>
all i can really say is that the script by aaron sorkin a few good men and scott frank dead again is intelligent and impressive in its plausible intricacy <>
there is an ingenious red herring crafted into the story which successfully diverts attention from other key elements <>
there were moments when i sensed the entire audience realizing the same thing at the same time <>
i saw very little of that telltale sign of a confusing mystery people leaning over to friends and spouses to ask what just happened <>
every explanation was clear and smooth if not always perfectly believable <>
{1} if theres one problem with the plotheavy script its that certain character developments are shallow <>
bill pullman is very good as the pleasant everyman with a streak of jealousy but his character would have benefited from some early evidence to make his later behavior more believable <>
ditto nicole kidman who has the most challenging role <>
i found bebe neuwirth basically annoying as a police detective sporting an accent that appeared to be a mutant hybrid of boston brahmin and brooklyn italian <>
on the plus side anne bancroft has a showy bit part as a loony mentor a la robin williams in dead again apparently a scott frank trademark <>
alec baldwin is perfect as jed delivering a great speech about his god complex with utter conviction <>
baldwin should stick to roles such as this which require colossal displays of hubris <>
{2} director harold becker showed his talent for atmospheric suspense in sea of love and surpasses that effort with malice <>
while never spectacularly tense malice is always gripping thanks to a methodical unfolding of the story with something important happening in almost every scene <>
becker even cleverly undercuts genre expectations particularly in an ominously underscored shot of a big dark house on a cliff overlooking crashing surf during a thunderstorm <>
the audience was in hysterics <>
this is a smart deft directing job and one that establishes becker as a name to watch for <>
{2} i think i can get away with saying that you shouldnt go into malice expecting a screamoutloud suspense film <>
its more subtle than that but never less than thoroughly intriguing <>
this is a mystery for mystery lovers <>

[2133/8]
{1} viewers of the age of innocence will likely fall into one of two camps those who consider it a minor masterpiece and those who consider it a huge bore <>
there is something to be said for both sides <>
director martin scorsese has crafted a sumptuous and dazzling visual feast from edith whartons novel of social propriety and repressed desire <>
but one that suffers from an overlong second act and a lack of character depth <>
while still an exceptional film experience it is ultimately one which i found much more engaging intellectually than emotionally <>
{0} the age of innocence is the story of newland archer daniel daylewis a lawyer in s new york and a member of the privileged class <>
he is engaged to may welland winona ryder a pleasant but oblivious girl from another prominent family <>
on the day of their engagement announcement archer is reintroduced to mays cousin ellen olenska michelle pfeiffer an unhappily married countess who has left her european husband for the support of her family in new york <>
ellen wants a divorce but the family fears a scandal and entreats archer to persuade her to drop the suit <>
as archer becomes ellens confidante he realizes that she is one of the few people who shares his distaste for the shallowness of their world <>
he falls in love with ellen and finds himself forced to choose between what he most desires and what is demanded of him by his society <>
{1} the age of innocence is a tale of surfaces of a society concerned with the appearance of things rather than the reality <>
it is a world where male infidelity is tacitly accepted provided the man does not flaunt his indiscretion a world where a declined dinner invitation is a social snubbing understood by both parties but never expressly stated <>
scorsese captures this obsession with surfaces by letting his camera dwell on things rather than people calling cards watch fobs earrings and table settings all become icons of status and civility <>
meanwhile a running narration by joanne woodward calls attention to the coded meanings and ironies in every word and gesture <>
its a fascinating anthropological study highlighted by typically bravura scorsese moments including a piercingly insightful tour through one house during a formal ball <>
yet for all its virtuosity i found the age of innocence working essentially as a documentary not the forbidden love story which is at its core <>
scorsese is so good at establishing the framework that he has little time left for the characters <>
they are kept at a distance which may in part be the point but left me a bit cold <>
{2} the performers are not to be held responsible for these shortcomings <>
daylewis is quite good as archer particularly in a scene with pfeiffer where he desperately struggles to find the polite vocabulary to tell her people will think shes a whore if she gets a divorce <>
he carries himself as though he is constantly on the brink of exploding but knows that it is impossible to do so <>
i had feared that pfeiffer would end up repeating her madame du tourveil from dangerous liaisons but she is too canny an actress for that <>
she invests ellen with as much as the script will allow her and then some making her a sad and slightly embittered woman who knows that being a woman means never being able to find your own happiness <>
ryder has a thankless part as may and seems almost as uncomfortable as she was in bram stokers dracula it appears to be time for her to forego period drama <>
miriam margolyes is delightful as mays eccentric and knowing granny mingott but the rest of the cast is forced to do what it can with roles which essentially function as archers obstacles they are not really characters in their own right <>
{2} however the films technical credits alone make it required viewing <>
longtime scorsese collaborator thelma schoonmaker does a glorious editing job and even gets her name on a billboard in the film <>
cinematographer michael ballhaus takes some stunning and instantly memorable shots including an ocean panorama which looks like a painting <>
elmer bernsteins score is lush and evocative and the costume and production design are certain oscar nominees <>
{1} the age of innocence demonstrates yet again that martin scorsese could direct dick and jane into a visual spectacle <>
its a fascinating examination of lifeless and soulless time and my attention never waned <>
but i kept finding myself oddly detached wanting to care more about whether or not archer and ellen would find happiness together but never quite able to do so <>
there is so much to admire about the age of innocence that it seems like nitpicking but im funny that way i want to be caught up in love stories <>

[2107/2]
{-2} some movies require you to turn off your brain in order to watch <>
then there are movies that require you to accept that everyone in the movie has turned off their brains <>
the real mccoy is both <>
its charmless molassesslow and so full of genuinely stupid people that the film commission of atlanta where the real mccoy is set might well consider some sort of ritual suicide for their complicity in this humiliation <>
{0} the real mccoy opens with bank robber karen mccoy kim basinger being arrested in the middle of a job <>
six years later karen is out on parole and looking to stay straight <>
she soon bumps into j t barker val kilmer a hapless wouldbe thief who idolizes karen <>
j t also has ties to jack schmidt terence stamp the man who blew the whistle on karen six years earlier for refusing to work with him <>
schmidt who is in cahoots with karens sleazy parole officer gailard sartain again wants karen to help him stage a robbery <>
this time he has some leverage karens kidnapped son <>
just when she thought she was out they keep pulling her back in <>
{-2} contrivances and sloppy plotting fly off the screen so fast and furiously you have to duck to avoid being hit by them <>
leading the list is the jack schmidt character who through unexplained but presumably foul mains is already extremely wealthy when our story begins <>
there is no reason given why he should need or want to get involved in another crime let alone why he would actually participate in the breakin <>
karens initial encounter with j t during a botched convenience store holdup also strains the limits of credibility <>
it would have been simple enough to have them somehow entangled at that point but instead they run into each other the next day because theyre leaving their parole officers at exactly the same moment <>
small world eh <>
then theres the convenient car trouble during an attempted escape and pet tigers which through the power of the laws of bad cinema must inevitably confront someone who has blundered into their cage <>
however the buffoon prize goes to the atlanta police who come off like the keystone kops on a bad day <>
{-2} but the fun doesnt end there in the shambles of a script by william davies and william osborne <>
there is also the absence of a single solitary interesting character <>
karen is earnest and singleminded in her motherly devotion but lacking any kind of edge which would make her a convincing criminal and basinger is not a thespian adept at fleshing out flimsy material <>
schmidt is a flaccid villain the parole officer is a complete blank and karens son and exhusband might as well be furniture <>
only kilmers j t is remotely appealing but his one potentially intriguing quality his ineptitude is never developed <>
in fact kilmer disappears during the middle of the film just when his admiration for karen could have made for an interesting subplot <>
{-2} i might have been more forgiving if the pacing had been more appropriate to a caper comedy but the real mccoy goes nowhere fast <>
various scenes of sneaking and skulking seem to take forever and some end with no reason evident why they didnt end up on the cutting room floor <>
even the reasonably clever climactic breakin falls victim to this syndrome including a scene of one of the thieves drilling open a vault which lasts i kid you not four minutes <>
there is no tension in the scene just tedium <>
russell mulcahy highlander is a director with some style and indeed the real mccoy looks reasonably good but he completely stumbles in the editing room <>
{-2} there are so many big problems with the real mccoy that im tempted to overlook the little ones <>
like karen disarming one of schmidts henchmen and throwing his gun into the middle of a park where her son is playing <>
like a fountain crushed when a van runs into it reappearing in one piece a few moments later <>
{-1} tempted but im pretty good at resisting temptation <>

{-2} needful things is the eighteenth feature film based on the published works of authorcumcottage industry stephen king <>
if one adds sequels original screenplays and television adaptations that totals roughly hours of film treatment about two thirds of which has been useful only as a mild sedative <>
although to state that kings works have fared poorly in translation to the screen may be to give him more credit than he is due it is certainly true that king on screen has been far less successful than king in print <>
that is not likely to change with needful things <>
lacking the suspense to be a crossover hit like misery or sufficient mayhem to please the freddy krueger crowd it treads a soggy middle ground going for cheap laughs rather than working up solid scares <>
{0} set in kings favorite haunted hamlet of castle rock maine still thriving in spite of serial killings a rabid st bernard and two or three minor demonic possessions needful things begins with the arrival of leland gaunt max von sydow a grandfatherly sort who opens a curio shop called needful things <>
it turns out to be a rather special shop one wherein every patron can find the one thing that he or she wants most in the world <>
as a fee gaunt asks only that the purchaser perform a small task a prank on a fellow citizen <>
when the pranks begin to turn sour sheriff alan pangborn ed harris begins to investigate and slowly begins to believe that mr gaunt is not exactly what he seems <>
{-1} there is the germ of an intriguing idea in needful things one borrowed from ray bradburys something wicked this way comes what would you be willing to do for your hearts desire <>
add to that the simmering hatreds and intolerance beneath the veneer of polite interaction and theres the potential for something beyond your runofthemill gore fest <>
screenwriter w d richter and director fraser c heston set up reasonably well but dont deliver <>
needful things seems to take forever to get any kind of momentum going and when it does at last seem to be moving it runs into a brick wall of silly dialogue and shoddy acting <>
{-1} the latter is somewhat surprising given the reasonably talented cast <>
the performances range from the competent bonnie bedelia as the sheriffs girlfriend to the confused harris to the scenery chewing almost everyone else <>
valri bromfield sneers and swears as a loony turkey farmer <>
amanda plummer does a new england accented variation on her standard eccentric <>
j t walsh seems to be channeling jack nicholsons performance from the shining but without the charisma as the towns pompous leading citizen <>
the biggest shock is von sydow who seems completely miscast <>
he appears to revel in the campier elements never bringing any genuine menace to gaunt <>
its hard to stir up any dread towards a character who calls his enemy a wussy <>
{-2} i suppose the blame for that lies with richter best know as the creator of the campy cult favorite the adventures of buckaroo banzai <>
he seems to have been a poor choice for this job sacrificing suspense for silly punch lines <>
his blackhumored approach to the story just didnt work <>
similarly director heston yes that hestons son doesnt quite have the deft touch required to direct suspense <>
he does a nice job with the fantasy sequences as gaunt entices his customers but other elements go completely astray <>
he never gives his actors a sense for the proper tone which makes it appear that harris and bedelia are acting in a different movie than everyone else <>
and he lays on the atmospheric smoke in gaunts shop so thick i thought i could see it puffing in from offcamera <>
needful things is muddled and in too many of the wrong hands <>
{1} i did find a few moments of amusement all of which were probably unintentional <>
in one scene a jukebox skips while playing achy breaky heart repeating the title over and over <>
also ironic is harris statement that this is a quiet town <>
given castle rocks history in the king canon quiet is definitely not the adjective which springs to mind <>
{-1} i think a line by gaunt summarizes needful things better than i ever could a couple of deaths a few explosions not my best work but what the hell <>
